0,Bench press exercise: the key points.,"Padulo J, Laffaye G, Chaouachi A, Chamari K.","The bench press exercise (BPE) is receiving increasing interest as a field testing, training/therapeutic modality to improve neuromuscular performance or to increase bone mass density. Several studies have been performed using BPE as a standard for increasing upper-limb strength. For this purpose, the position of the bar, the loads, the sets, the number of repetitions, the recovery time in-between sets, the movement speed, the muscular work and the use of the determination of the one repetition maximum (1-RM) are the classical tools investigated in the literature that have been shown to affect the BPE effect on neuromuscular. The goal of the present short review is to make a picture of the current knowledge on the bench press exercise, which could be very helpful for a better understanding of this standard movement and its effects. Based on the related literature, several recommendations on these key points are presented here.

1,A systematic review of surface electromyography analyses of the bench press movement task.,"Stastny P, Gołaś A, Blazek D, Maszczyk A, Wilk M, Pietraszewski P, Petr M, Uhlir P, Zając A.","Background:
        
      
      The bench press exercise (BP) plays an important role in recreational and professional training, in which muscle activity is an important multifactorial phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to systematically review electromyography (EMG) studies performed on the barbell BP exercise to answer the following research questions: Which muscles show the greatest activity during the flat BP? Which changes in muscle activity are related to specific conditions under which the BP movement is performed?
Strategy:
        
      
      PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library were searched through June 10, 2016. A combination of the following search terms was used: bench press, chest press, board press, test, measure, assessment, dynamometer, kinematics and biomechanics. Only original, full-text articles were considered.
Results:
        
      
      The search process resulted in 14 relevant studies that were included in the discussion. The triceps brachii (TB) and pectoralis major (PM) muscles were found to have similar activity during the BP, which was significantly higher than the activity of the anterior deltoid. During the BP movement, muscle activity changes with exercise intensity, velocity of movement, fatigue, mental focus, movement phase and stability conditions, such as bar vibration or unstable surfaces. Under these circumstances, TB is the most common object of activity change.
Conclusions:
        
      
      PM and TB EMG activity is more dominant and shows greater EMG amplitude than anterior deltoid during the BP. There are six factors that can influence muscle activity during the BP; however, the most important factor is exercise intensity, which interacts with all other factors. The research on muscle activity in the BP has several unresolved areas, such as clearly and strongly defined guidelines to perform EMG measurements (e.g., how to elaborate with surface EMG limits) or guidelines for the use of exact muscle models.

2,"Effect of Five Bench Inclinations on the Electromyographic Activity of the Pectoralis Major, Anterior Deltoid, and Triceps Brachii during the Bench Press Exercise.","Rodríguez-Ridao D, Antequera-Vique JA, Martín-Fuentes I, Muyor JM.","The bench press exercise is one of the most used for training and for evaluating upper-body strength. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the electromyographic (EMG) activity levels of the pectoralis major (PM) in its three portions (upper portion, PMUP, middle portion, PMMP, and lower portion, PMLP), the anterior deltoid (AD), and the triceps brachii (TB) medial head during the bench press exercise at five bench angles (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60°). Thirty trained adults participated in the study. The EMG activity of the muscles was recorded at the aforementioned inclinations at 60% of one-repetition maximum (1RM). The results showed that the maximal EMG activity for PMUP occurred at a bench inclination of 30°. PMMP and PMLP showed higher EMG activity at a 0° bench inclination. AD had the highest EMG activity at 60°. TB showed similar EMG activities at all bench inclinations. In conclusion, the horizontal bench press produces similar electromyographic activities for the pectoralis major and the anterior deltoid. An inclination of 30° produces greater activation of the upper portion of the pectoralis major. Inclinations greater than 45° produce significantly higher activation of the anterior deltoid and decrease the muscular performance of the pectoralis major.

3,The Effects of Bench Press Variations in Competitive Athletes on Muscle Activity and Performance.,"Saeterbakken AH, Mo DA, Scott S, Andersen V.","The aim of the study was to compare the EMG activity performing 6RM competition style bench press (flat bench-wide grip) with 1) medium and narrow grip widths on a flat bench and 1) inclined and declined bench positions with a wide grip. Twelve bench press athletes competing at national and international level participated in the study. EMG activity was measured in the pectoralis major, anterior and posterior deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii and latissimus dorsi. Non-significant differences in activation were observed between the three bench positions with the exception of 58.5-62.6% lower triceps brachii activation, but 48.3-68.7% greater biceps brachii activation in the inclined bench compared with the flat and declined bench position. Comparing the three grip widths, non-significant differences in activations were observed, with the exception of 25.9-30.5% lower EMG activity in the biceps brachii using a narrow grip, compared to the medium and wide grip conditions. The 6-RM loads were 5.8-11.1% greater using a medium and wide grip compared to narrow grip width and 18.5-21.5% lower in the inclined bench position compared with flat and declined. Comparing the EMG activity during the competition bench press style with either the inclined and declined bench position (wide grip) or using a narrow and medium grip (flat bench), only resulted in different EMG activity in the biceps- and triceps brachii. The 6RM loads varied with each bench press variation and we recommend the use of a wide grip on a flat bench during high load hypertrophy training to bench press athletes.

4,Push-Ups vs. Bench Press Differences in Repetitions and Muscle Activation between Sexes.,"Alizadeh S, Rayner M, Mahmoud MMI, Behm DG.","Push-ups are an ubiquitous resistance training exercise. While exhibiting a relatively similar upper body motion to the bench press, there are substantial differences in repetitions when employing similar relative loads. The objective was to examine sex-related differences in repetitions and muscle activation associated with push-ups and bench press exercises. Twenty resistance-trained participants (10 men [22 ± 6.1 years] and 10 [24 ± 5.7 years] women) performed maximum push-up and bench press repetitions with loads relative to the body mass during a push-up. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were positioned on the middle and anterior deltoids, triceps and biceps brachii, and pectoralis major muscles and their relative (normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction) activity was compared between the two exercises performed to task failure. Both females (3.5 ± 3.9 vs.15.5 ± 8.0 repetitions; p = 0.0008) and males (12.0 ± 6.3 vs. 25.6 ± 5.2 repetitions; p < 0.0001) performed 77.4% and 53.1% less bench press than push-up repetitions respectively. Males significantly exceeded females with both push-ups (p = 0.01) and bench press (p = 0.004) repetitions. Significant linear regression equations were found for females (r2 = 0.55; p = 0.03), and males (r2 = 0.66; p < 0.0001) indicating that bench press repetitions increased 0.36 and 0.97 for each push-up repetition for females and males respectively. Triceps (p = 0.002) and biceps brachii (p = 0.03) EMG mean amplitude was significantly lower during the push-up concentric phase, while the anterior deltoid (p = 0.03) exhibited less activity during the bench press eccentric phase. The sex disparity in repetitions during these exercises indicates that a push-up provides a greater challenge for women than men and regression equations may be helpful for both sexes when formulating training programs.

5,Understanding Bench Press Biomechanics-The Necessity of Measuring Lateral Barbell Forces.,"Mausehund L, Werkhausen A, Bartsch J, Krosshaug T.","Mausehund, L, Werkhausen, A, Bartsch, J, and Krosshaug, T. Understanding bench press biomechanics-The necessity of measuring lateral barbell forces. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-The purpose of this study was to advance the expertise of the bench press exercise by complementing electromyographic (EMG) with net joint moment (NJM) and strength normalized NJM (nNJM) measurements, thus establishing the magnitude of the elbow and shoulder muscular loads and efforts. Normalized NJMs were determined as the ratio of the bench press NJMs to the maximum NJMs produced during maximum voluntary isokinetic contractions. Furthermore, we wanted to assess how changes in grip width and elbow positioning affected elbow and shoulder NJMs and nNJMs, and muscle activity of the primary movers. Thirty-five strength-trained adults performed a 6-8 repetition maximum set of each bench press variation, while elbow and shoulder NJMs and EMG activity of 7 upper extremity muscles were recorded. The results show that all bench press variations achieved high elbow and shoulder muscular efforts. A decrease in grip width induced larger elbow NJMs, and larger EMG activity of the lateral head of the triceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and clavicular head of the pectoralis major (p ≤ 0.05). An increase in grip width elicited larger shoulder NJMs and nNJMs, and larger EMG activity of the abdominal head of the pectoralis major (p ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, all bench press variations may stimulate strength gains and hypertrophy of the elbow extensors and shoulder flexors and horizontal adductors. However, greater adaptations of the elbow extensors and shoulder flexors may be expected when selecting narrower grip widths, whereas wider grip widths may induce greater adaptations of the shoulder horizontal adductors.

6,Low-load bench press and push-up induce similar muscle hypertrophy and strength gain.,"Kikuchi N, Nakazato K.","Aim:
        
      
      To investigate the effect of push-up training with a similar load of to 40% of 1- repetition maximumal (1RM) bench press on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain in men.
Methods:
        
      
      Eighteen male participants (age, 20.2 ± 0.73 years, range: 19-22 years, height: 169.8 ± 4.4 cm, weight: 64.5 ± 4.7 kg) were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: bench press at 40%1RM (bench-press group, n = 9) or push-ups with position adjusted (e.g. kneeling) to the same load of bench-press 40%1RM (push-up group, n = 9), performed twice per week for 8 weeks. Muscle thickness at three sites (biceps, triceps, and pectoralis major), bench-press 1RM, maximum repetition at 40%1RM, and power output (medicine ball throw) were measured before and after the training period.
Results:
        
      
      Significant increases in 1RM and muscle thickness (triceps and pectoralis major) were observed in bench-press group (1RM, from 60.0 ± 12.1 kg to 65.0 ± 12.1 kg, p < 0.01; triceps, from 26.3 ± 3.7 mm to 27.8 ± 3.8 mm, p < 0.01; pectoralis major, from 17.0 ± 2.8 mm to 20.8 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.01) and in the push-up group (1RM, from 61.1 ± 12.2 kg to 64.2 ± 12.5 kg, p < 0.01; triceps, 27.7 ± 5.7 mm to 30.4 ± 6.6 mm, p < 0.01; pectoralis major, from 17.0 ± 2.8 mm to 20.8 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.01). Biceps thickness significantly increased only in the bench-press group (28.4 ± 3.3 mm to 31.5 ± 3.7 mm, p < 0.01). Neither power output performance nor muscle endurance capacity changed in either group.
Conclusions:
        
      
      Push-up exercise with similar load to 40%1RM bench press is comparably effective for muscle hypertrophy and strength gain over an 8-week training period.

7,Influence of bench angle on upper extremity muscular activation during bench press exercise.,"Lauver JD, Cayot TE, Scheuermann BW.","This study compared the muscular activation of the pectoralis major, anterior deltoid and triceps brachii during a free-weight barbell bench press performed at 0°, 30°, 45° and -15° bench angles. Fourteen healthy resistance trained males (age 21.4 ± 0.4 years) participated in this study. One set of six repetitions for each bench press conditions at 65% one repetition maximum were performed. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was utilised to examine the muscular activation of the selected muscles during the eccentric and concentric phases. In addition, each phase was subdivided into 25% contraction durations, resulting in four separate time points for comparison between bench conditions. The sEMG of upper pectoralis displayed no difference during any of the bench conditions when examining the complete concentric contraction, however differences during 26-50% contraction duration were found for both the 30° [122.5 ± 10.1% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)] and 45° (124 ± 9.1% MVIC) bench condition, resulting in greater sEMG compared to horizontal (98.2 ± 5.4% MVIC) and -15 (96.1 ± 5.5% MVIC). The sEMG of lower pectoralis was greater during -15° (100.4 ± 5.7% MVIC), 30° (86.6 ± 4.8% MVIC) and horizontal (100.1 ± 5.2% MVIC) bench conditions compared to the 45° (71.9 ± 4.5% MVIC) for the whole concentric contraction. The results of this study support the use of a horizontal bench to achieve muscular activation of both the upper and lower heads of the pectoralis. However, a bench incline angle of 30° or 45° resulted in greater muscular activation during certain time points, suggesting that it is important to consider how muscular activation is affected at various time points when selecting bench press exercises.

8,Understanding Bench Press Biomechanics-Training Expertise and Sex Affect Lifting Technique and Net Joint Moments.,"Mausehund L, Krosshaug T.","Mausehund, L and Krosshaug, T. Understanding bench press biomechanics-Training expertise and sex affect lifting technique and net joint moments. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-The purpose of this study was to compare normalized net joint moments (NJMs), moment arms, and muscle activity in the bench press exercise between powerlifters and recreationally strength-trained lifters and between women and men. Thirty-four healthy adults, including 12 powerlifters (6 women and 6 men) and 22 recreational lifters (9 women and 13 men), performed a 6-8 repetition maximum set of the bench press, while elbow and shoulder NJMs and moment arms and electromyographic (EMG) activity of 6 upper extremity muscles were recorded. The results showed that training expertise and sex affected bench press technique substantially. Powerlifters applied a different bar path which impacted joint kinematics to a greater extent and joint kinetics to a lesser extent. Specifically, powerlifters had lower normalized peak elbow NJMs and shorter joint ROMs than recreational lifters (p <= 0.05), yet no differences in normalized shoulder NJMs and muscle activity were observed. Women showed lower normalized mean shoulder NJMs, higher normalized peak elbow NJMs, and higher mean elbow to shoulder NJM ratios than men (p <= 0.05). The muscle activity of the long head of the triceps brachii and the elbow to shoulder EMG ratio were higher, yet muscle activity of the sternocostal and abdominal head of the pectoralis major was lower for female than for male subjects (p <= 0.05). In conclusion, powerlifters and men are more shoulder dominant when performing the bench press than recreational lifters and women, respectively. These findings will have implications for resistance training program design, expected training adaptations and bench press performance.

Squat and bench press force-velocity profiling in male and female adolescent rugby players. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S44-S50, 2021-Power development is critical for enhancing rugby performance because there is a close relationship between power and sport-specific skills. The aim of this study was to examine the force-velocity profiling generated by adolescent rugby players in the squat and bench press exercises and to compare sex-related differences. Subjects were 46 men (age: 14.48 ± 1.31 years; body height: 1.65 ± 0.09 m; and body mass: 58.07 ± 13.01 kg) and 41 women (age: 14.93 ± 2.76 years; body height: 1.63 ± 0.12 m; and body mass: 59.23 ± 12.66 kg) who were recruited from a national amateur rugby league team. Maximal strength, power, and velocity were assessed on the squat and bench press exercises using a Smith Machine and a linear power transducer with intensities ranging from 40 to 80% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) on the squat and 50-80% 1RM on the bench press. 1 repetition maximum squat and bench press performance were 104.26 ± 30.83 and 46.97 ± 13.59 kg, respectively, for men and 115.17 ± 41.42 and 45.85 ± 16.71 kg, respectively, for women. The maximum squat power results for men and women were 521.91 ± 298.75 and 591.26 ± 352.69 W, respectively, and the maximum bench press power results for men and women were 190.26 ± 150.54 and 326.16 ± 195.57 W, respectively. Significant sex-related differences (p < 0.001) were found on the squat exercise for maximum (40%), mean (40-50%), and time to maximum velocities (40-80%) as well as time to maximum power (80%). On the bench press exercise, significant sex-related differences (p < 0.001) were found for power and time to maximum velocity (40%-60%-70%-80%). These results may aid in the design of strength and conditioning programs for adolescent rugby players by targeting training prescriptions toward enhancing strength or velocity.

10,Pre-exercise Caffeine Intake Enhances Bench Press Strength Training Adaptations.,"Giráldez-Costas V, Ruíz-Moreno C, González-García J, Lara B, Del Coso J, Salinero JJ.","Previous research has identified acute caffeine intake as an effective ergogenic aid to enhance velocity and power during bench press exercise. However, no previous investigation has analyzed the effects of chronic intake of caffeine on training adaptations induced by bench press strength training. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of pre-exercise caffeine intake on training adaptations induced by a bench press training protocol. Using a double-blind, randomized experimental design, 16 healthy participants underwent a bench press training protocol for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Seven participants ingested a placebo and nine participants ingested 3 mg/kg/BM of caffeine before each training session. Three days before, and 3 days after the completion of the training protocol, participants performed a one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press and force-velocity test (from 10 to 100% 1RM). From comparable pre-training values, the strength training similarly increased 1RM in the caffeine and placebo groups (+13.5 ± 7.8% vs. +11.3 ± 5.3%, respectively; p = 0.53). In the caffeine group, the strength training induced a higher mean velocity at 40%, (0.81 ± 0.08 vs. 0.90 ± 0.14 m/s), 60% (0.60 ± 0.06 vs. 0.65 ± 0.06 m/s), 70% (0.47 ± 0.05 vs. 0.55 ± 0.06 m/s), 80% (0.37 ± 0.06 vs. 0.45 ± 0.05 m/s), 90% (0.26 ± 0.07 vs. 0.34 ± 0.06 m/s), and 100% 1RM (0.14 ± 0.04 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05 m/s; p < 0.05) while the increases in the placebo group were evident only at 30 (0.95 ± 0.06 vs. 1.03 ± 0.07 m/s), 70% (0.51 ± 0.03 vs. 0.57 ± 0.05 m/s) and 80% 1RM (0.37 ± 0.06 vs. 0.45 ± 0.05 m/s) (p < 0.05). The placebo group only increased peak velocity at 60 and 70% 1RM (p < 0.05) while peak velocity increased at 10%, and from 30 to 100% 1RM in the caffeine group (p < 0.05). The use of 3 mg/kg/BM of caffeine before exercise did not modify improvements in 1RM obtained during a 4 week bench press strength training program but induced more muscle performance adaptations over a wider range of load.

Potentiation of bench press throw performance using a heavy load and velocity-based repetition control. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S72-S79, 2021-The acute effects of heavy load bench press exercise on subsequent bench press throw (BPT) performance and surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity were examined using movement velocity control. Eleven resistance-trained men completed 3 conditions in randomized and counterbalanced order. In 2 conditions, bench press was performed as fast as possible against a load of 80% of 1 repetition maximum, until mean velocity dropped to 90% (C90) or 70% (C70) of the fastest repetition. In the control condition, no bench press was performed. Single maximal BPT efforts were performed in all conditions after warm-up and throughout the 12 minutes of subsequent recovery. Mean propulsive velocity (MPV), peak velocity (PV), and sEMG activity of the prime mover muscles were measured during the BPT efforts. The total number of repetitions and volume load during bench press were significantly greater in C70 compared with C90 (6.5 ± 1.9 vs. 3.4 ± 0.9 repetitions and 557.8 ± 177.8 vs. 293.8 ± 95.7 kg, p < 0.01). In C90, MPV was increased 5.3-7.4% (p < 0.01) for a prolonged period (4-12 minutes), while in C70, MPV increased only at 10 minutes (+5.9%, p < 0.01) and 12 minutes (+4.3%, p < 0.01). Peak velocity was improved only in the C90 at 8-12th min by 3.6-4.7% (p ≤ 0.05). Surface electromyographic activity of the pectoralis major muscle was significantly greater than baseline at 10 minutes of recovery only in the C90 (p < 0.01). Performance gains may be optimized by taking into account the individual fatigue profiles, allowing a percentage drop of only 10% in movement velocity during the conditioning bench press exercise.

12,Effect of Bench Press Load Knowledge on One Repetition Maximum Strength.,"Snarr RL, Adams K, Cook J.","Snarr, RL, Adams, K, and Cook, J. Effect of bench press load knowledge on one repetition maximum strength. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2121-2126, 2021-Knowledge of a given load and visual feedback are crucial while performing a given task. Although previous literature has examined the consequences of lifting a submaximal weight, the removal of load knowledge has yet to be examined under maximal effort. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the differences in 1 repetition maximum (1RM) bench press values between a known and unknown external load. Twenty resistance-trained subjects (10 male subjects and 10 female subjects) completed 2 trials of a 1RM bench press protocol separated by 48-72 hours. The two 1RM trials consisted of (a) a traditional 1RM lift in which subjects could see the external load and (b) a 1RM lift in which the external load was blocked from view of the subject. Trials were randomized for all subjects. Results indicated that no differences were observed when the load was known vs. unknown within all subjects (p = 0.094; Cohen's d = 0.03; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99). In addition, 40% decreased and 15% increased their 1RM, despite the unknown condition. A statistical difference was found between the initial 1RM estimation vs. measured 1RM during the known load trial (p = 0.034, Cohen's d = 0.07). Practitioners should note that load knowledge before a maximal lift does not appear to present any significant detrimental effects on performance. Therefore, training during a ""blinded"" condition may present a unique modality and additional balance component that would not be presented during a traditional maximal lift. Further examination of attentional focus and muscle activation differences are warranted.

Seventeen resistance-trained men, with 9.4±4.7 years of resistance training experience were recruited. After a familiarization session assessing 1 repetition maximum (RM) in the bench press, participants performed: 1) bench press with traditional stable loading 2) bench press with loads (2x5kg) attached as pendulums swinging forward/backwards and 3) left/right in randomized order. The total load was 70% of the 1RM load. Electromyography was measured in the pectoralis major, anterior- and posterior deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii and external obliques. Using stable loads, the pectoralis major demonstrated lower EMG amplitude compared to the two unstable conditions. In the external obliques, the stable conditions demonstrated lower EMG amplitude than the swing in the mediolateral direction, but not the anteroposterior direction. There were no differences between two swinging loads or the three conditions for the triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid or posterior deltoid. In conclusion, swinging in bench press resulted in similar EMG amplitude in the shoulder- and arm muscles, but greater pectoralis and external oblique (only mediolateral swing) activity compared to bench press.

14,Bench Press Load-Velocity Profiles and Strength After Overload and Taper Microcyles in Male Powerlifters.,"Williams TD, Esco MR, Fedewa MV, Bishop PA.","Williams, TD, Esco, MR, Fedewa, MV, and Bishop, PA. Bench press load-velocity profiles and strength after overload and taper microcyles in male powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 34(12): 3338-3345, 2020-The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of an overload microcycle and taper on bench press velocity and to determine if the load-velocity relationship could accurately predict 1-repetition maximum (1RM). Twelve male powerlifters participated in resistance training structured into an introduction microcycle, overload microcycle (PostOL), and taper (PostTP). At the end of each microcycle, subjects completed a bench press for 1RM assessment consisting of warm-up sets at 40, 55, 70, and 85% of a previously established 1RM. The mean concentric velocity (MCV) was recorded during each warm-up set. A predicted 1RM (p1RM) was calculated using an individualized load-velocity profile (LVP). The average MCV decreased after PostOL (0.66 ± 0.07 m·s) compared with baseline (BL) (p = 0.003; 0.60 ± 0.11 m·s) but increased after PostTP (0.67 ± 0.09 m·s). One-repetition maximum increased from PostOL (146.7 ± 19.8 kg) to PostTP (p = 0.002; 156.1 ± 21.0 kg), with no differences observed between other test sessions (p > 0.05). Bland-Altman analysis indicated that p1RM was consistently higher than measured 1RM (3.4-7.8 kg), and the limits of agreement were extremely wide. However, very large to near perfect correlations (r = 0.89 to 0.96) were observed between p1RM and 1RM during BL, PostOL, and PostTP. The load-velocity relationship established from submaximal sets did not accurately predict 1RM, but MCV was affected by changes in weekly training loads. Velocity-based measurements seem to be more sensitive to changes in training loads than maximal strength.

15,Bench press performance during an intermittent hypoxic resistance training to muscle failure.,"Martínez-Guardado I, Sánchez-Ureña B, Olcina G, Camacho-Cardenosa A, Camacho-Cardenosa M, Timón R.","Background:
        
      
      Resistance training performed under hypoxia conditions has been shown to cause major metabolic and hormonal responses. However, the influence of hypoxia on an acute session has been barely studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of an intermittent hypoxic resistance training (IHRT) to muscle failure on bench press performance.
Methods:
        
      
      A randomized crossover design was performed, and 25 untrained men performed a resistance training under two different conditions: normoxia (FIO2=21%) and high-level hypoxia (FIO2=13%). Resistance training consisted of 3 sets of 75% 1RM to muscle failure, with a 2-minute rest between sets. Physical performance was assessed by quantifying total repetitions, concentric velocity and power variable during all sets. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), capillary blood lactate and muscle soreness were also assessed after training.
Results:
        
      
      Physical performance during bench press did not differ under hypoxic conditions (P>0.05). However, there were significant increases (P<0.05) of RPE (from 7.5±0.8 to 7.9±0.8) and blood lactate concentrations (from 5.5±1.2 to 6.2±1.5 mmol/L) in the hypoxia group.
Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings suggest that hypoxic resistance exercise does not affect exercise performance during bench press exercise. However, influence to perceived exercise intensity and blood lactate concentrations, suggesting that hypoxic resistance training may add substantially to the training dose experienced.

16,The 'Bench Rite' Orthosis Decreases Cervical Muscle Activation During the Bench Press.,"Baumgarten KM, Pfiefle BK, Chang KC.","Background:
        
      
      There is little data available that examines the activation of the cervical paraspinal muscles that occurs during the bench press. It is intuitive that activation of these muscles may lead to increased loads across the cervical spine and may increase the risk of injury to the intervertebral disks of the cervical spine.
Hypothesis:
        
      
      The hypothesis of this study is that by supporting the cervical spine with the ""Bench Rite"" cervical spine orthosis, there will be less muscular activation of the cervical paraspinal muscles as determined by electromyography when performing the bench press.
Study design:
        
      
      Comparative electromyographic study - Level of evidence III (case-control study).
Methods:
        
      
      Fifteen healthy subjects performed two sets (with and without the cervical orthosis) of five repetitions of a 60 percent maximum repetition on the bench press for each muscle group tested (pectoralis major, deltoid, C5 paraspinal, trapezius). Electromyography was used to determine the maximum isometric contraction and concentric contraction of each muscle with and without the cervical orthosis. The concentric contraction of each muscle group was reported as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction.
Results:
        
      
      The use of the ""Bench Rite"" cervical spine orthosis resulted in a statistically significant decrease in muscle activation in the C5 paraspinal (37 percent; p=0.0001) and deltoid muscles (9.8 percent; p=0.001) and a significant increase in trapezius muscle activation (9.3 percent; p=0.03). No differences were found in muscle activation of the pectoralis major with or without the use of the cervical spine orthosis (0.8 percent; p=0.90).
Conclusions:
        
      
      Weightlifters may consider utilizing the ""Bench Rite"" cervical orthosis while performing the bench press to decrease cervical paraspinal muscle activation without impacting the muscle activation of the pectoralis major.

17,Concentric-Only Versus Touch-and-Go Bench Press One-Repetition Maximum in Men and Women.,"García-Ramos A, Janicijevic D, Jukic I.","Background:
        
      
      One-repetition maximum (1RM) tests are time-consuming, and they might not always be logistically possible or warranted due to increased risk of injury when performed incorrectly or by novice athletes. Repetitions-to-failure tests are a widespread method of predicting the 1RM, but its accuracy may be compromised by several factors such as the type of exercise, sex, training history, and the number of repetitions completed in the test.
Hypothesis:
        
      
      The touch-and-go bench press would provide a higher 1RM than the concentric-only bench press for both genders regardless of whether the 1RM was obtained by the direct or repetitions-to-failure method and the error in the 1RM prediction would be positively correlated with the number of repetitions performed to failure and negatively correlated with the 1RM strength and resistance training experience.
Study design:
        
      
      Cross-sectional study.
Level of evidence:
        
      
      Level 3.
Methods:
        
      
      A total of 113 adults (87 men and 26 women) were tested on 2 sessions during the concentric-only and touch-and-go bench press. Each session consisted of an incremental loading test until reaching the 1RM load, followed by a repetitions-to-failure test.
Results:
        
      
      The 1RM was higher for the touch-and-go bench press using both the direct (men, 7.80%; women, 7.62%) and repetitions-to-failure method (men, 8.29%; women, 7.49%). A significant, although small, correlation was observed between the error in the estimation of the 1RM and the number of repetitions performed (r = 0.222; P < 0.01), 1RM strength (r = -0.169; P = 0.01), and resistance training experience (r = -0.136; P = 0.05).
Conclusion:
        
      
      The repetitions-to-failure test is a valid method of predicting the 1RM during the concentric-only and touch-and-go bench press variants. However, the accuracy of the prediction could be compromised with weaker and less experienced individuals and if more than 10 repetitions are completed during the repetitions-to-failure test.
Clinical relevance:
        
      
      The repetitions-to-failure test does not require any sophisticated equipment and enables a widespread use in different training environments.

18,Effects of bouncing the barbell in bench press on throwing velocity and strength among handball players.,"Løken J, Solstad TEJ, Stien N, Andersen V, Saeterbakken AH.","Bench press is a popular training-exercise in throw related sports such as javelin, baseball and handball. Athletes in these sports often use bouncing (i.e., letting the barbell collide with the chest) to create an increased momentum to accelerate the barbell upwards before completing the movement by throwing the barbell. Importantly, the effects of the bouncing technique in bench press have not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of bench press throw with (BPTbounce) or without bounce (BPT) on throwing velocity (penalty and 3-step), 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) and average power output (20-60kg) in bench press among handball players. Sixteen male amateur handball players (7.1±1.9 years of handball experience) were randomly allocated to an eight-week supplementary power training program (2 x week-1) with either the BPT or BPTbounce. Except for the bounce technique, the training programs were identical and consisted of 3 sets with 3-5 repetitions at 40-60% of 1-RM with maximal effort in free-weight barbell bench press throw. The results revealed no significant differences between the groups in any of the tests (p = 0.109-0.957). However, both groups improved penalty throw (BPT; 4.6%, p<0.001, ES = 0.57; BPTbounce; 5.1%, p = 0.008, ES = 0.91) and 1-RM (BPT; 9.7%, p<0.001, ES = 0.49; BPTbounce; 8.7%, p = 0.018, ES = 0.60), but only the BPT improved the 3-step throw (BPT; 2.9%, p = 0.060, ES = 0.38; BPTbounce; 2.3%, p = 0.216, ES = 0.40). The BPT improved power output only at 20kg and 30kg loads (9.1% and 12.7%; p = 0.018-0.048, ES = 0.43-0.51) whereas BPTbounce demonstrated no significant differences across the loads (p = 0.252-0.806). In conclusion, the bounce technique demonstrated similar effects on throwing velocity, muscle strength and muscle power output as conventional bench press throw without the bounce technique.

19,Impact of Spotter Sex on One Repetition Maximum Bench Press Performance.,"Nickerson BS, Salinas G, Garza JM, Cho S, Snarr RL.","Nickerson, BS, Salinas, G, Garza, JM, Cho, S, and Snarr, RL. Impact of spotter sex on one repetition maximum bench press performance. J Strength Cond Res 35(9): 2397-2400, 2021-Resistance exercise is popular because of favorable health outcomes associated with increased muscular fitness. For these reasons, 1 repetition maximum (1RM), mean velocity (MV), and peak power (PP) are of interest during the bench press. However, research has yet to evaluate whether spotter sex impacts bench press performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of spotter sex on bench press performance during a 1RM testing protocol. Twenty resistance-trained individuals (10 men and 10 women) visited the laboratory on 2 separate occasions. Estimated 1RM was self-reported by subjects before the 1RM protocol. During their visits, subjects had their 1RM (kg), MV (m·s-1), and PP (W) determined on a bench press 1RM protocol while using a male or female spotter. Deception was used by telling subjects the intent of the study was to determine the reliability of a linear position transducer for measuring MV and PP during the 1RM trials. The main findings revealed that measured 1RM values for male weight lifters were significantly higher than estimated 1RM values when using both a male (p = 0.01) and female spotter (p < 0.01). In addition, results revealed MV and PP were significantly higher for the 1RM trials when male weight lifters had a male spotter (both p < 0.01). Alternatively, there were no significant differences in estimated vs. measured 1RM values for women as well as no effect of spotter sex on bench press strength (all p > 0.05). Practitioners should note that sex of a spotter does not seem to impact measured 1RM. However, notable influences may be observed within MV and PP.

Hyperventilation-aided recovery for extra repetitions on bench press and leg press. J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1274-1284, 2020-Hyperventilation (HV)-induced alkalosis, an ergogenic strategy, improved repeated pedaling sprint performance through enhanced H removal. However, it did not confer beneficial effects on other forms of exercises. This study investigated the benefits of HV-aided recovery on lifting repetitions and joint velocity during resistance training involving multiple joints and both concentric and eccentric contractions. Eleven power-trained men (mean ± SD age: 22.5 ± 4.3 years, training experience: 8.3 ± 3.6 years) performed 6 sets each of bench press and leg press at 80% 1 repetition maximum. Each set was continued until failure, with a 5-minute recovery between sets. In protocol A, HV was implemented for 30 seconds before the first, third, and fifth sets of each exercise (HV-aided recovery), whereas spontaneous breathing continued throughout the recovery before the second, fourth, and sixth sets (control recovery). In protocol B, the order of the HV and control recoveries was reversed. For both protocols, reductions in repetitions (range: -4.7% to -22.5%) and velocity (range: -23.1% to -37.7%) were consistently observed after control recovery (p < 0.05), whereas HV-aided recovery resulted in increased repetitions (range: +21.3% to +55.7%) and velocity (range: +6.3% to +15.3%) (p < 0.05) or no reductions in these measures from the previous set. The total repetitions performed across 6 sets (protocols A and B combined) were greater after the HV-aided than control recovery (p ≤ 0.001) in bench press (44 ± 10 vs. 36 ± 10 reps, increased by 27.1 ± 24.1%) and leg press (64 ± 9 vs. 50 ± 15 reps, increased by 35.2 ± 29.5%). Hyperventilation-aided recovery may boost the effectiveness of resistance training through increased training volume and lifting velocity.

Thirteen strength-trained men participated in this study (age = 25.7 ± 1.9 years, body mass = 94.8 ± 8 kg, 1 repetition maximum [1RM] = 147 ± 14.2 kg, and strength training experience = 6.5 ± 2.2 years). The subjects performed 2 conditioning sets of the bench press exercise of 2 repetitions each, with a 5 minutes rest interval between sets, using the ECCONLY mode against 110% or 130% of concentric 1RM load. The 1 repetition of the CONONLY bench press throw with a load of 30% 1RM was performed before and 5 minutes after the conditioning activity (CA) to assess changes in peak power (PP) and peak velocity (PV). The differences between the analyzed variables before and after the CA were determined using a 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance. There was an increase of PP by 10.5 ± 6.0% (effect size [ES] = 0.34) and 9.9 ± 8.1% (ES = 0.33) for the 110 and 130% of concentric 1RM conditions, respectively, with no difference between the 2 conditions (p < 0.01 main effect time, no interaction). Similarly, PV increased by 5.9 ± 5.5% (ES = 0.40) and 6.1 ± 6.1% (ES = 0.43) for the 110 and 130% of concentric 1RM conditions, respectively, with no difference between the 2 conditions (p < 0.01 main effect time, no interaction). Activation with an ECCONLY contraction and loads exceeding 1RM are effective at improving power output and bar velocity during the CONONLY bench press throw.

Twenty-one resistance-trained individuals (male = 12, female = 9) performed a 3-week familiarization block followed by randomization into 1 of 2 upper- and lower-body split training routines performed for 8 weeks. The bench press was the only exercise manipulated with subjects using either cluster-set (CLUS, n = 11) or traditional-set (TRAD, n = 10) structures during training sessions. Subjects performed 4 sets of 5 repetitions at 85% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) with CLUS having a 30-second inter-repetition, and 3-minute interset rest while TRAD had a 5-minute interset rest. A load-velocity profile of relative loads derived from a 1RM test was used to assess velocity and power (absolute and relative to body mass) on the bench press. Significant improvements over time were found across various loads ranging from 45 to 75% 1RM for absolute and relative peak power (p = 0.006-0.041), and mean power (p = 0.001-0.032). Significant decreases over time were found at 55% 1RM and 65% 1RM for peak velocity (p = 0.027 and p = 0.012, respectively) and mean velocity (p = 0.047 and p = 0.022, respectively). There were no significant group or group by time interactions found for all outcomes. Within the context of high-load resistance training, set structure seems to be of less importance for changes in bench press velocity and power provided there is an intention to lift with maximal concentric velocity.

The results showed that the ""SS"" significantly increased bench press 1RM performance by a mean ± SD of 20.67 ± 3.4 kg. Barbell velocity and stick point analysis indicate that this improvement is likely driven by an increase in peak and prestick barbell velocity as triceps root mean square (RMS) was lower throughout all rep max phases with the ""SS."" The ""SS"" also caused reductions in RMS, specifically of the triceps at all rep ranges but barbell velocity was better maintained in the last reps of all sets. These data indicate that the ""SS"" specifically deloaded the triceps muscle throughout all rep ranges and provide assistance to maintaining barbell velocity under fatigue during later repetitions of multiple repetition sets. The ""SS"" training aid could therefore be used in deload phases of bench press training or as an overreaching and velocity training aid.

Participants completed two bench press exercise trials of (a) No music (NM), and (b) Pre-exercise music (PreExM) separated by at least 48 hours. For each trial, following a warm-up, participants listened to music or no music for three minutes. After this 3-minute period, they completed one set of bench press repetitions with maximum explosive intent at 75% one repetition maximum (1 RPM). We used a rotary encoder to measure power and velocity of barbell movement. After a 3-minute rest during which they again listened to music or no music, participants completed another set of repetitions to failure (RTF) at 75% of 1RM. Immediately following this second set of repetitions, we measured exercise motivation with a visual analog scale (VAS). We found that the PreExM condition increased mean power output (p = 0.005; d = 0.792) and barbell velocity (p = 0.015; d = 0.722). RTF were significantly higher during the PreExM versus NM trial (p = 0.002; d = 0.985), and motivation was significantly higher in the PreExM trial versus NM (p = 0.001; d = 0.932). These findings suggest improved muscle power explosiveness and strength-endurance when listening to music before a bench press exercise. From a practical standpoint, athletes who have the option of listening to music immediately prior to resistance exercise may benefit from its use.

Ten strength trained men (bench press one-repetition maximum (1-RM): 124.3 ± 19.4 kg; relative strength ratio: 1.5 ± 0.2 kg∙body mass-1) participated. Subjects completed bench press repetitions using concentric loads from 30% to 80% 1-RM in 10% increments in each experimental session. The AEL protocols were implemented using 100% (AEL100) and 110% 1-RM (AEL110) loads during the eccentric action, while the eccentric load remained the same as the concentric for traditional loading (TRAD). Multilevel models analyzed the effects of each AEL protocol on concentric velocities across concentric loads (p < 0.05). Faster concentric velocities were observed at 30% 1-RM and 80% 1-RM with AEL100 compared to TRAD (p ≤ 0.05) but this effect was reduced for individuals moving the barbell through a greater displacement. Additionally, AEL110 presented a greater change in velocity from 30% to 80% 1-RM than TRAD (p ≤ 0.05). The AEL100 protocol resulted in faster concentric velocities throughout concentric loads of 30-80% 1-RM, but AEL110 may have been too great to elicit consistent performance enhancements. Thus, the efficacy of AEL at various concentric loads is dependent on the eccentric loading and barbell displacement.

Training was conducted once a week for eight weeks, with equalized number of sets among groups. Muscle thickness, isometric strength and electromyography (EMG) amplitude of the pectoralis major were measured one week before and after the training period. There was no difference between groups for the change in horizontal bench press isometric strength (~ 10 kg increase, p=0.776) or incline bench press isometric strength (~ 11 kg increase, p=0.333). Changes in muscle thickness differed only in one of the three sites. The changes in the second intercostal space of the pectoralis major was greatest in the incline pressure group compared with the horizontal [mean difference (95% CI) of 0.62 (0.23, 1.0) cm, p=0.003] and combination groups [mean difference (95% CI) of 0.50 (0.14, 0.86) cm, p=0.008]. The change in EMG amplitude following training differed between groups in only one out of the four sites. The present results indicate that strength and conditioning professionals might consider that horizontal and incline bench press exercises, or a combination of both exercises can render similar change in general strength.

27,Effect of Rest Interval Duration on the Volume Completed During a High-Intensity Bench Press Exercise.,"Hernandez DJ, Healy S, Giacomini ML, Kwon YS.","Hernandez, DJ, Healy, S, Giacomini, ML, and Kwon, YS. Effect of rest interval duration on the volume completed during a high-intensity bench press exercise. J Strength Cond Res 35(11): 2981-2987, 2021-Between-set rest intervals (RIs) are one of the most important variables in resistance training; however, no known research has investigated the effects of RIs greater than 5 minutes during high-intensity strength training. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of 3 different RIs on repetition sustainability and training volume (sets × reps × resistance) during a high-intensity bench press exercise. Fifteen resistance-trained male subjects (mean ± SD, age = 25.5 ± 4.5 years, and bench press 1 repetition maximum [1RM] ratio [1RM/body mass] = 1.39 ± 0.1) completed 3 experimental sessions, during which 4 sets of the bench press were performed with 85% of 1RM load. Subjects performed the bench press using 3 different RIs in a random counterbalanced design. Data were analyzed using both a one- and two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. As sets progressed, repetitions were significantly different (p < 0.05) between all RIs, and only the 8-minute RI (p < 0.05) allowed for the complete sustainability of repetitions over 4 consecutive sets. Subjects attained the greatest training volume (p < 0.05) using an 8-minute RI between sets compared with a 2- or 5-minute RI. Similarly, a significantly greater training volume was achieved using the 5-minute RI compared with the 2-minute RI. Resistance-trained men, with the goal of greater volume during strength training, would benefit from longer RIs, specifically using an 8-minute RI between 4 consecutive sets of a bench press exercise.

28,Creatine electrolyte supplement improves anaerobic power and strength: a randomized double-blind control study.,"Hummer E, Suprak DN, Buddhadev HH, Brilla L, San Juan JG.","Background:
        
      
      Creatine supplementation aids the Phosphagen system by increasing the amount of free creatine and phosphocreatine available to replenish adenosine triphosphate. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a creatine and electrolyte formulated multi-ingredient performance supplement (MIPS) on strength and power performance compared to a placebo. Maximal strength along with total concentric work, mean rate of force development (mRFD), mean power, peak power, and peak force for both bench press and back squat were determined at pre-test and post-test separated by 6 weeks of supplementation.
Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-two subjects (6 females, 21 ± 2 yrs., 72.46 ± 11.18 kg, 1.72 ± 0.09 m) performed a one-repetition maximum (1RM) for back squat and bench press. Eighty percent of the subject's pre-test 1RM was used for a maximal repetition test to assess performance variables. Testing was separated by 6 weeks of supplementation of a MIPS dose per day in a double-blind fashion for comparison. A two-way mixed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied with an alpha level of 0.05.
Results:
        
      
      For their back squat 1RM, the MIPS group displayed significant increase of 13.4% (95% CI: 2.77, 23.8%) while placebo displayed a decrease of - 0.2% (95% CI: - 1.46, 2.87%) (p = 0.047, ηp2 = 0.201). The MIPS displayed a significant increase of 5.9% (95% CI: 2.5, 10.1%) and placebo displayed a non-significant increase of 0.7% (95% CI: - 3.49, 3.9%) in bench press maximal strength (p = 0.033,0.217). The MIPS group displayed a significant increase as well in total concentric work (26.5, 95% CI: 6.07, 46.87%, p = 0.008, ηp2 = 0.330) and mean power (17.9, 95% CI: 3.42, 32.46%, p = 0.003, ηp2 = 0.402) for the maximal repetition bench press test at 80% of their 1RM.
Conclusions:
        
      
      The MIPS was found to be beneficial to recreationally trained individuals compared to a placebo. The greatest benefits are seen in bench press and back squat maximal strength as well as multiple repetition tests to fatigue during the bench press exercise.

29,The Acute Post-Activation Performance Enhancement of the Bench Press Throw in Disabled Sitting Volleyball Athletes.,"Krzysztofik M, Matykiewicz P, Celebanska D, Jarosz J, Gawel E, Zwierzchowska A.","The purpose of the present study was to examine the acute effects of the bench press exercise with predetermined velocity loss percentage on subsequent bench press throw (BPT) performance with raised legs or feet on the floor among disabled, sitting volleyball players. Twelve elite sitting volleyball athletes (age = 33 ± 9 years; body mass = 84.7 ± 14.7 kg; relative bench press maximum strength = 1.0 ± 0.3 kg/body mass) took part in this study. The experiment was performed following a randomized crossover design, where each participant performed a single set of bench press with a 60% one-repetition maximum (1RM) to a 10% decrease of mean bar velocity as a conditioning activity (CA). The BPT with a 60%1RM was performed to assess changes in peak power (PP), peak velocity (PV) before and after the CA. The differences between analyzed variables before and after the CA were verified using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (condition × time; 2 × 2). The ANOVA showed a significant main effect of time for peak bar velocity (p = 0.03; η2 = 0.312) and peak power output (p = 0.037; η2 = 0.294). The post hoc comparison showed a significant increase in post-CA peak bar velocity and peak power for raised legs condition in comparison with pre-CA value (p = 0.02, p = 0.041, respectively). The present study showed that the subsequent BPT performed with raised legs could be enhanced by the bench press with a 60% 1RM to a 10% mean bar velocity decrease as a CA among disabled sitting volleyball players. Therefore, athletes and coaches can consider performing a bench press throw with raised legs without compromising performance.

30,The influence of somatotype on anaerobic performance.,"Ryan-Stewart H, Faulkner J, Jobson S.","The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p < 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p < 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R2 = 0.388, p < 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.

Comparison of velocity-based and traditional percentage-based loading methods on maximal strength and power adaptations. J Strength Cond Res 34(1): 46-53, 2020-This study explored the effects of velocity-based training (VBT) on maximal strength and jump height. Sixteen trained men (22.8 ± 4.5 years) completed a countermovement jump (CMJ) test and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) assessment on back squat, bench press, strict overhead press, and deadlift, before and after 6 weeks of resistance training. Participants were assigned to VBT or percentage-based training (PBT) groups. The VBT group's load was dictated through real-time velocity monitoring, as opposed to pretesting 1RM data (PBT). No significant differences were present between groups for pretesting data (p > 0.05). Training resulted in significant increases (p < 0.05) in maximal strength for back squat (VBT 9%, PBT 8%), bench press (VBT 8%, PBT 4%), strict overhead press (VBT 6%, PBT 6%), and deadlift (VBT 6%). Significant increases in CMJ were witnessed for the VBT group only (5%). A significant interaction effect was witnessed between training groups for bench press (p = 0.004) and CMJ (p = 0.018). Furthermore, for back squat (9%), bench press (6%), and strict overhead press (6%), a significant difference was present between the total volume lifted. The VBT intervention induced favorable adaptations in maximal strength and jump height in trained men when compared with a traditional PBT approach. Interestingly, the VBT group achieved these positive outcomes despite a significant reduction in total training volume compared with the PBT group. This has potentially positive implications for the management of fatigue during resistance training.

Upper-body resistance exercise reduces time to recover after a high-volume bench press protocol in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S180-S187, 2021-The aim of this study was to compare the effects of active and passive strategies on the recovery response after a high-volume bench press protocol. Twenty-five resistance-trained men (mean ± SD: age = 25.8 ± 3.6 years; body mass = 87.1 ± 12.1 kg; and height = 177.4 ± 4.9 cm) performed a high-volume bench press session (8 sets of 10 reps at 70% of 1 repetition maximum). Subsequently, they were randomly assigned to an active recovery (AR) group (n = 11) or to a passive recovery (PR) group (n = 14). Active recovery consisted of light bench press sessions performed 6 hours and 30 hours after the high-volume exercise protocol. Muscle performance (bench throw power [BTP] and isometric bench press [IBP]) and morphology (muscle thickness of pectoralis major [PECMT] and of triceps brachii [TRMT]) were measured before exercise (baseline [BL]), and at 15-minute (15P), 24-hour (24P), and 48-hour (48P) post-exercise. Post-exercise recovery of both maximal strength and power was accelerated in AR compared with PR. Both BTP and IBP were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced at 15P and 24P in PR, whereas changes were significant (p < 0.001) at 15P only in AR. PECMT was still significantly (p = 0.015) altered from BL at 48P in PR, whereas changes were significant (p < 0.001) at 15P only in AR. No significant interactions (p > 0.05) between PR and AR were detected for TRMT and muscle soreness. The present results indicate that AR enhances the recovery rate after high-volume exercise sessions and may be included in resistance training programs to optimize muscle adaptations.

33,Comparison of Kinematics and Muscle Activation between Push-up and Bench Press.,Tillaar RVD.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the similarity in kinematics and upper-body muscle activation between push-up and bench press exercises over a range of loads. Twenty resistance-trained subjects (age 22.5±5.24 yrs, body mass 83.7±10.7 kg, height 1.80±0.06 m) executed bench presses and push-ups with 4 different loads. Bench press was executed at 50-80% of their assumed 1 repetition max in steps of 10 kg, while push-ups were executed without a weight vest and with a 10-20-30 kg weight vest. A linear encoder measured kinematics (displacement, time, average and peak velocity) during the exercises at each load, together with mean and maximal muscle activation of 8 upper body muscles and their timing for each exercise and each load. The main findings of this study demonstrate no differences in kinematics and muscle activation between the two exercises and that the different loads had the same effect upon both push-up and bench press in experienced resistance-trained men. For coaches and athletes, push-ups and bench presses for strength training can be used interchangeably. By using a weight vest, push-ups can mimic different loads that are similar to different intensities in the bench press that can be used to train strength demands.

34,The Effects of Plyometric Conditioning on Post-Activation Bench Press Performance.,"Krzysztofik M, Wilk M.","The present study aimed to determine the effects of plyometric push-ups as a conditioning activity (CA) on high-loaded bench press performance. Two groups of resistance-trained males age (24.5 ± 2.6 years, body mass 84.8 ± 8 kg) performed one of two CA protocols: 3 sets of 5 repetitions of plyometric push-ups with a 1 min rest interval between sets (PAPE; n=12) or equal time aerobic warm-up (CONT; n=12). Four minutes after completion of the CA protocols the participants performed 3 sets of 3 repetitions of the bench press exercise at 70%1RM and 4 min rest interval between sets to assess post-activation differences in peak power output (PP), mean power output (MP), peak bar velocity (PV), and mean bar velocity (MV) between conditions. The two-way ANOVA revealed significant condition × set interaction effect for PP (p<0.01), MP (p<0.05), PV (p<0.01), and MV (p=0.02). The post hoc for condition × set interaction showed that PAPE caused a significant decrease in PP and PV for P-Set2 and P-Set3 when compared to baseline (BA). The MP and MV for the PAPE condition decreased significantly during the P-Set3 compared to BA and to P-Set1. The t-test comparisons for delta values showed significant differences between PAPE and CONT in PP for P-Set1 - BA (p<0.01), in MP for P-Set2 - P-Set1 (p<0.03) and for P-Set3 - P-Set1 (p=0.04). Furthermore, there were significant differences in PV for P-Set3 - BA; P-Set2 - P-Set1; P-Set3 - P-Set1 (p<0.01; p<0.01; p<0.02 respectively). Finally, there were significant differences in MV for P-Set1 - BA; P-Set2 - P-Set1 and P-Set3 - P-Set1 (p<0.01; p<0.01; p<0.02 respectively). This study demonstrated that plyometric push-ups lead to performance enhancement of the bench press exercise at 70%1RM. The increases in performance were observed only in the first set following the CA, while a significant decrease of these variables was registered in P-Set2 and P-Set3.

35,Specific prime movers' excitation during free-weight bench press variations and chest press machine in competitive bodybuilders.,"Coratella G, Tornatore G, Longo S, Esposito F, Cè E.","The current study compared the muscle excitation in free-weight bench press variations and chest press machine. Ten competitive bodybuilders were recruited. The EMG-RMS amplitude of clavicular and sternocostal head of pectoralis major, long head of triceps brachii and anterior and lateral deltoid was recorded while performing horizontal (BP), inclined (45°) (IBP) or declined (-15°) bench press (DBP) and chest press machine (CP). Four non-exhaustive repetitions were performed using 80% of 1-repetition maximum of each exercise. Both concentric and eccentric phases were recorded. During the concentric phase, [d effect size: 2.78/7.80] clavicular head was more excited in IBP and less excited in CP (d: -9.69/-4.39) compared to all other exercises. The sternocostal head was similarly excited in DBP vs. BP and BP vs. CP and more excited (d: 2.42/9.92) compared to IBP. Triceps brachii excitation was overall greater (d: 2.01/6.75) in BP and DBP compared to all other exercises. Anterior deltoid was less excited (d: 3.84/19.77) in DBP compared to all other exercises. Lateral deltoid excitation was greater (d: 0.96/3.10) in BP, IBP and DBP compared to CP. Muscle excitation during the eccentric phase followed a similar pattern, with the exception of the greater (d: 3.89/11.32) excitation in the clavicular head in BP compared to all other exercises. The present outcomes showed that the excitation of the clavicular and sternocostal head of pectoralis major depends on the bench inclination angle. The use of BP variations vs. CP allows overall greater triceps brachii and lateral deltoid excitation, due to the greater instability.

Effects of augmented eccentric load bench press training on one repetition maximum performance and electromyographic activity in trained powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1512-1519, 2021-Augmented eccentric load (AEL) training has been shown to elicit greater lower-body muscular strength increases and faster performance improvements compared with traditional strength training. However, it is unknown whether AEL training could provide similar improvements in upper-body muscular strength. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of a 4-week AEL training program on bench press one repetition maximum (1RM) strength, bar kinetics and kinematics, and surface electromyography (EMG) activity. Eight competitive powerlifters completed 5 training sessions consisting of 7 sets of a single repetition with up to 5 minutes rest between sets. Each session was completed at a predetermined AEL percentage consisting of 90% 1RM for concentric and supramaximal loads ranging from 105 to 125% 1RM during the eccentric phase with the use of eccentric hooks. After 4 weeks of AEL training, 1RM performance significantly increased from pretest to posttest (116.62 ± 27.48-124.28 ± 26.96 kg, p = 0.001). In addition, EMG amplitude of the pectoralis major decreased during the 125% AEL session to 59.86 ± 15.36% of pretest 1RM EMG values (p = 0.049, effect sizes [ESs] = 0.69). Furthermore, peak power of 1RM increased by 36.67% from pretest to posttest (p = 0.036, ES = 0.58). These study findings suggest that incorporating AEL bench press training into a 4-week training cycle may be a novel strategy to improve 1RM performance in competitive powerlifters in a short period.

Ten healthy strength-trained men (age = 27.9 ± 3.7 years; body mass = 90.1 ± 12.5 kg; resistance training experience = 6.5 ± 2.7 years; bench press one-repetition maximum (1RM) = 118.5 ± 21 kg) performed a single set of 3 repetitions of the bench press exercise with an SB and a CB at 50%1RM to assess differences in peak power output (PP), mean power output (MP), peak bar velocity (PV), and mean bar velocity (MV), range of motion (ROM), and positive work time under load (TUL) between conditions. The t-test indicated significantly higher mean ROM for the cambered bar in comparison to the standard bar (52.7 vs. 44.9 cm; P < 0.01; ES = 1.40). Further, there was a significantly higher PP (907 vs. 817 W; P < 0.01; ES = 0.35), MP (556 vs. 496 W; P < 0.01; ES = 0.46), PV (1.24 vs. 1.14 m/s; P < 0.01; ES = 0.35) and MV (0.89 vs. 0.82 m/s; P < 0.01; ES = 0.34) for the CB condition when compared to the SB. A significantly longer TUL for the CB was observed, when compared to the SB (1.89 vs. 1.51 s; P < 0.01; ES = 1.38). The results of this study showed that the CB significantly increased power output and bar velocity in the bench press exercise at 50%1RM compared to the SB. Therefore, the additional ROM, made possible through the use of the CB, allows for the acceleration of the bar through a significantly longer displacement, which has a positive impact on power output. However, a simultaneous increase in TUL may cause higher fatigue when the bench press is performed with the CB compared to the SB.

Twelve male subjects advanced in resistance training (RT) (age, 25.5 ± 4.4 years) completed 2 experimental trials in a counterbalanced crossover design: a-tDCS and sham conditions. The stimulus was applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 minutes using a 2-mA current intensity in a-tDCS condition and 1 minute of active stimulus in the sham condition. Immediately after stimulation, subjects performed the bench press followed by the back squat. The exercise protocol consisted of 3 sets of maximum repetitions at an intensity of 80% of 1 repetition maximum. The volume-load, perceived pleasure, and arousal responses were measured during the RT protocol. The results indicated that volume-load was higher in the a-tDCS condition than in the sham condition for both exercises (p = 0.02), with large effect for the back squat (p = 0.045; d = 0.96). The higher volume-load was obtained by increasing the number of repetitions across all sets for the bench press (p ≤ 0.0001) and only in the first set for the back squat (p = 0.01). The circumplex model analysis showed a higher pleasure in the bench press and a tendency toward a higher pleasure in the a-tDCS condition. Anodal tDCS may be used as an ergogenic resource for increasing the back squat volume after performing the bench press in resistance-trained male subjects.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-This study evaluated the reliability and concurrent validity of the OUTPUT sports inertial unit to measure concentric velocity of free-weight back squat and bench press exercises. Eleven men and women performed back squat and bench press 1 repetition maximum (1RM) testing. One week later, subjects performed 3 repetitions of each exercise with 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, and 85% 1RM (18 total repetitions). The OUTPUT and 4 cable extension transducers (criterion) simultaneously recorded the mean and peak velocity. The OUTPUT had acceptable reliability for all loads except 85% 1RM for back squat and bench press (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.72-0.96, coefficient of variation = 0.03-0.12). High systematic biases existed for the mean and peak velocity for the back squat and bench press, according to Bland-Altman plot's wide limits of agreement and ordinary least products regressions. According to Bland-Altman plots, OUTPUT tended to overestimate bench press velocity and overestimate back squat velocity at slower velocities. Least products regression analyses determined proportional bias existed for the mean and peak velocity of the back squat and peak velocity of the bench press. In conclusion, researchers and practitioners are advised not to compare velocity estimates of the OUTPUT unit with criterion devices because these methods cannot be used interchangeably. However, because of the demonstrated reliability when estimating the mean and peak velocity, strength and conditioning practitioners may find the OUTPUT unit valuable for monitoring performance of the back squat and bench press exercises. Yet, caution should be taken when evaluating loads ≥85% 1RM.

40,Movement velocity can be used to estimate the relative load during the bench press and leg press exercises in older women.,"Marcos-Pardo PJ, González-Hernández JM, García-Ramos A, López-Vivancos A, Jiménez-Reyes P.","Background:
        
      
      Movement velocity has been proposed as an effective tool to prescribe the load during resistance training in young healthy adults. This study aimed to elucidate whether movement velocity could also be used to estimate the relative load (i.e., % of the one-repetition maximum (1RM)) in older women.
Methods:
        
      
      A total of 22 older women (age = 68.2 ± 3.6 years, bench press 1RM = 22.3 ± 4.7 kg, leg press 1RM = 114.6 ± 15.9 kg) performed an incremental loading test during the free-weight bench press and the leg press exercises on two separate sessions. The mean velocity (MV) was collected with a linear position transducer.
Results:
        
      
      A strong linear relationship between MV and the relative load was observed for the bench press (%1RM = -130.4 MV + 119.3; r 2 = 0.827, standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 6.10%1RM, p < 0.001) and leg press exercises (%1RM = -158.3 MV + 131.4; r 2 = 0.913, SEE = 5.63%1RM, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the bench press and leg press exercises for the MV attained against light-medium relative loads (≤70%1RM), while the MV associated with heavy loads (≥80%1RM) was significantly higher for the leg press.
Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that the monitoring of MV could be useful to prescribe the loads during resistance training in older women. However, it should be noted that the MV associated with a given %1RM is significantly lower in older women compared to young healthy individuals.

42,"Impact of Red Spinach Extract Supplementation on Bench Press Performance, Muscle Oxygenation, and Cognitive Function in Resistance-Trained Males.","Haynes JT 4th, Townsend JR, Aziz MA, Jones MD, Littlefield LA, Ruiz MD, Johnson KD, Gonzalez AM.","The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of short-term dietary nitrate supplementation, in the form of red spinach extract (RSE), on bench press performance, muscle oxygenation, and cognitive function in resistance-trained males. Ten resistance-trained males participated in this randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation. Each participant completed 7 days of either RSE (2 g; 180 mg NO3-) or a maltodextrin placebo (PL) in a counterbalanced fashion with a 14-day washout between treatments. During experimental visits, participants were provided their 8th and last dose of RSE or PL 40 min before completing 5 sets of the barbell bench press exercise to failure at 75% of a predetermined 1-repetition maximum with 2 min rest intervals. Mean and peak power were recorded via a linear transducer. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was implemented to estimate muscle oxygenation, a Stroop Test was used to assess cognitive function, and subjective performance ratings were obtained in relation to the acute resistance exercise sessions. Data were analyzed via separate repeated measures analyses of variance. There were no time by group interactions for bench press repetitions (p = 0.549), peak power (p = 0.061), or mean power (p = 0.877) across the 5 sets of bench press. Additionally, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed for any measure of muscle oxygenation, Stroop performance, or subjective performance ratings. It appears that 7 days of RSE supplementation did not alter performance, muscle oxygenation, nor Stroop scores during or following the bench press exercise in resistance-trained males.

43,Association Between Maximal Bench Press Strength and Isometric Handgrip Strength Among Breast Cancer Survivors.,"Rogers BH, Brown JC, Gater DR, Schmitz KH.","Objective:

Setting:
        
      
      Laboratory.
Participants:
        
      
      Community-dwelling breast cancer survivors (N=295).
Interventions:
        
      
      Not applicable.
Main outcome measure:
        
      
      1-RM bench press strength was measured with a barbell and exercise bench. Isometric handgrip strength was measured using an isometric dynamometer, with 3 maximal contractions of the left and right hands. All measures were conducted by staff with training in clinical exercise testing.
Results:
        
      
      Among 295 breast cancer survivors, 1-RM bench press strength was 18.2±6.1kg (range, 2.2-43.0kg), and isometric handgrip strength was 23.5±5.8kg (range, 9.0-43.0kg). The strongest correlate of 1-RM bench press strength was the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands (r=.399; P<.0001). Mean difference analysis suggested that the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands overestimated 1-RM bench press strength by 4.7kg (95% limits of agreement, -8.2 to 17.6kg). In a multivariable linear regression model, the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands (β=.31; P<.0001) and age (β=-.20; P<.0001) were positively correlated with 1-RM bench press strength (R2=.23).
Conclusions:
        
      
      Isometric handgrip strength is a poor surrogate for 1-RM bench press strength among breast cancer survivors. 1-RM bench press strength and isometric handgrip strength quantify distinct components of muscular strength.

44,Impact of Movement Tempo Distribution on Bar Velocity During a Multi-Set Bench Press Exercise.,"Trybulski R, Jarosz J, Krzysztofik M, Filip-Stachnik A, Matykiewicz P, Zmijewski P, Bichowska M, Wilk M.","The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of contrast tempo movement on bar velocity changes during a multi-set bench press exercise. In randomized and counter-balanced order, participants performed three sets of the bench press exercise at 60%1RM under two testing conditions: E-E where all repetitions were performed with explosive (X/0/X/0) movement tempo; and S-E where the first two repetitions were performed with a slow tempo (5/0/X/0) while the third repetition was performed with explosive movement tempo (slow, slow, explosive). Twelve healthy men volunteered for the study (age = 30 ± 5 years; body mass = 88 ± 10 kg; bench press 1RM = 145 ± 24 kg). The three-way repeated measures ANOVA (tempo × set × repetition) showed statistically significant multi-interaction effect for peak bar velocity (p < 0.01; η2 = 0.23), yet not for mean bar velocity (p = 0.09; η2 = 0.14). The post hoc results for multi-interaction revealed that peak bar velocity in the 3rd repetition was significantly higher for E-E compared to SE only during set 1 (p < 0.001). Therefore, the distribution of movement tempo had a significant impact on peak bar velocity, but not on mean bar velocity. The decrease in peak bar velocity in the 3rd repetition during the S-E condition was observed only in the first set, while such a tendency was not observed in the second and third set.

Effects of a 6-week bench press program using the freak bar in a sample of collegiate club powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 32(4): 938-949, 2018-Powerlifters train using specialty bars for unstable load (UL) training. For the bench press, the acute effects of UL are mixed, with few studies that examine training interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a 6-week bench press training program that uses the Freak Bar (FB) as compared to a traditional barbell (TB) on maximum bench press, peak force, and peak impulse. Seven men and 3 women (21 ± 2.0 years, 172.2 ± 2.9 cm, and 95.3 ± 20.3 kg) were required to bench press 2 days per week as part of a structured program. On the second bench press day, the FB and TB groups performed 3-position pause bench presses at 60-70% one repetition maximum (1RM). One repetition maximum, peak force, and peak impulse were measured before test and after test after the 6-week program. Peak force and peak impulse were tested at 3 bench positions, including the presticking, sticking, and poststicking points, defined by the distance of the barbell from the chest. Posttraining 1RM for the FB group and TB group increased 6.7% (6.78 ± 1.6 kg, p = 0.006) and 4.3% (4.5 ± 2.7 kg, p = 0.23), respectively, with no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.589, ηp = 0.044). There were no significant differences between the groups at each bench position for peak force (p = 0.606) or peak impulse (p = 0.542). Freak Bar can be an alternative for improving maximum strength and peak force but is not significantly better than TB training when performing the 3-position pause bench press.

46,The Effects of Ischemia During Rest Intervals on Bar Velocity in the Bench Press Exercise With Different External Loads.,"Jarosz J, Trybulski R, Krzysztofik M, Tsoukos A, Filip-Stachnik A, Zajac A, Bogdanis GC, Wilk M.","The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute effects of ischemia used during rest periods on bar velocity changes during the bench press exercise at progressive loads, from 20 to 90% of 1RM. Ten healthy resistance trained men volunteered for the study (age = 26.3 ± 4.7 years; body mass = 89.8 ± 6.3 kg; bench press 1RM = 142.5 ± 16.9 kg; training experience = 7.8 ± 2.7 years). During the experimental sessions the subjects performed the bench press exercise under two different conditions, in a randomized and counterbalanced order: (a) ischemia condition, with ischemia applied before the first set and during every rest periods between sets, and (b) control condition where no ischemia was applied. During each experimental session eight sets of the bench press exercise were performed, against loads starting from 20 to 90% 1RM, increased progressively by 10% in each subsequent set. A 3-min rest interval between sets was used. For ischemia condition the cuffs was applied 3 min before the first set and during every rest period between sets. Ischemia was released during exercise. The cuff pressure was set to ∼80% of full arterial occlusion pressure. The two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a statistically significant interaction effect for peak bar velocity (p = 0.04) and for mean bar velocity (p = 0.01). There was also a statistically significant main effect of condition for peak bar velocity (p < 0.01) but not for mean bar velocity (p = 0.25). The post hoc analysis for interaction showed significantly higher peak bar velocity for the ischemia condition compared to control at a load of 20% 1RM (p = 0.007) and at a load of 50% 1RM (p = 0.006). The results of the present study indicate that ischemia used before each set even for a brief duration of <3 min, has positive effects on peak bar velocity at light loads, but it is insufficient to induce such effect on higher loads.

47,Effect of Unstable Loads on Stabilizing Muscles and Bar Motion During the Bench Press.,"Lawrence MA, Ostrowski SJ, Leib DJ, Carlson LA.","Lawrence, MA, Ostrowski, SJ, Leib, DJ, and Carlson, LA. Effect of unstable loads on stabilizing muscles and bar motion during the bench press. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S120-S126, 2021-Unstable loads are anecdotally used to increase muscle stabilizer strength and utilization; however, there is little evidence to support these claims. Twelve male powerlifters (age 28.6 ± 5.2 years, body mass 105.6 ± 14.5 kg, lifting experience 9.8 ± 6.0 years, and bench press 5 repetition maximum [5RM] 133.6 ± 30.9 kg) pressed their 5RM in one stable condition with a standard barbell, and 3 unstable conditions using a flexible barbell with weights suspended from elastic bands. Mean integrated muscle activity for each repetition of the stabilizers and prime movers were measured. A Lyapunov exponent and sample entropy indicated unstable loads were less predictable and more variable in the superior/inferior direction, thus more challenging to control, despite decreased loads. The main finding was increased bicep activity in all unstable conditions (light bands and plates, +57%; mini bands and plates, +67%; and mini bands and kettlebells, +88%). Although less weight was used in the unstable 5RMs, most stabilizer muscle activity was not different between conditions, suggesting that the amount of weight used during unstable load training (up to 32.3% less load) may be limited by the ability of stabilizer muscles to control the load.

48,Influence of Grip Width and Anthropometric Characteristics on the Bench-Press Load-Velocity Relationship.,"Pérez-Castilla A, Jerez-Mayorga D, Martínez-García D, Rodríguez-Perea Á, Chirosa-Ríos LJ, García-Ramos A.","Purpose:
        
      
      To compare the load-velocity (L-V) relationship between bench-press exercises performed using 4 different grip widths, to determine the association between the anthropometric characteristics and L-V profile, and to explore whether a multiple linear-regression model with movement velocity and subjects' anthropometric characteristics as predictor variables could increase the goodness of fit of the individualized L-V relationship.
Methods:
        
      
      The individual L-V relationship of 20 men was evaluated by means of an incremental loading test during the bench-press exercise performed on a Smith machine using narrow, medium, wide, and self-selected grip widths. Simple and multiple linear-regression models were performed.
Results:
        
      
      The mean velocity associated with each relative load did not differ among the 4 grip widths (P ≥ .130). Only body height and total arm length were correlated with the mean velocity associated with light and medium loads (r ≥ .464). A slightly higher variance of the velocity attained at each relative load was explained when some anthropometric characteristics were used as predictor variables along with the movement velocity (r2 = .969 [.965-.973]) in comparison with the movement velocity alone (r2 = .966 [.955-.968]). However, the amount of variance explained by the individual L-V relationships was always higher than with the multiple linear-regression models (r2 = .995 [.985-1.000]).
Conclusions:
        
      
      These results indicate that the individual determination of the L-V relationship using a self-selected grip width could be recommended to monitor relative loads in the Smith machine bench-press exercise.

Forty resistance-trained males (19-30 years) performed 3 × 6 repetitions with 80% of maximal dynamic strength (designated as training load) after one of the following warm-ups (48 h between): (i) 2 × 6 repetitions with 40% and 80% of the training load (WU), (ii) 6 × 80% of training load (WU80), or (iii) 6 × 40% of the training load (WU40). Mean propulsive velocity (MPV), velocity loss (VL), peak velocity (PV), time to achieve PV, power, work, heart rates, and ratings of perceived exertion were analyzed. In squat exercises, higher MPV were found in WU80 compared with WU40 (2nd set: 0.69 ± 0.09 vs. 0.67 ± 0.06 m.s-1, p = 0.02, ES = 0.80; 3rd set: 0.68 ± 0.09 vs. 0.66 ± 0.07 m.s-1, p = 0.05, ES = 0.51).

The results showed that force outputs were mainly optimized by WU80 in squat training and by WU in bench press training. Moreover, warming-up with few repetitions and low loads is not enough to optimize squat and bench press performances.

50,Push-Ups are Able to Predict the Bench Press 1-RM and Constitute an Alternative for Measuring Maximum Upper Body Strength Based on Load-Velocity Relationships.,"van den Tillaar R, Ball N.","The aims of this study were firstly to compare the similarity in upper-body muscle activation between the bench press and push-up at similar loads, and secondly to establish a 1-RM prediction equation between the two exercises based upon the load-velocity relationship. Twenty resistance-trained male athletes (age 22.5 ± 5.24 years, body mass 83.7 ± 10.7 kg, body height 1.80 ± 0.06 m) performed push-ups and bench presses with four different loads. Push-ups were performed without a weight vest and with a 10-20-30 kg weight vest. Bench presses were performed at 50-80% of athletes' assumed 1 repetition max (1-RM) in 10 kg steps, while a linear encoder measured performance during the exercises. A load-velocity relationship was established as a product of the load and velocity for the push-up and bench press per participant and the equation was used to establish a predicted 1-RM. Mean muscle activation of eight upper body muscles was recorded for each exercise and each load. The main findings of this study demonstrate an extremely large association between the predicted 1-RM loads performed with the push-up and bench press (r = 0.93) in experienced resistance trained men. Furthermore, most muscles showed similar activations between the two exercises with the different loads except the deltoid and biceps brachii muscles. It may be concluded that it is possible to predict a cross-over 1-RM between the two exercises based upon the load-velocity relationship in each exercise, and that training push-ups largely targets the same muscles as the bench press except the deltoid and biceps muscles. For coaches and athletes, the use of this method is a low cost and time-effective alternative for standard 1-RM bench press testing to predict maximal upper body strength.

J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 10-15, 2022-Training at a particular range of motion (ROM) produces specific neuromuscular adaptations. However, the effects of full and partial ROM in one of the most common upper-limb exercises such as the bench press (BP) remain controversial. In this study, 50 recreationally to highly resistance trained men were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 training groups: full bench press (BPFULL), two-thirds bench press (BP2/3), and one-third bench press (BP1/3) and control (training cessation). Experimental groups completed a 10-week velocity-based resistance training program using the same relative load (linear periodization, 60-80% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]), only differing in the ROM trained. Individual ROM for each BP variation was determined in the familiarization and subsequently replicated in every lift during training and testing sessions. Neuromuscular adaptations were evaluated by 1RM strength and mean propulsive velocity (MPV). The BPFULL group obtained the best results for the 3 BP variations (effect size [ES] = 0.52-1.96); in turn, partial BP produced smaller improvements as the ROM decreased (BP2/3: ES = 0.29-0.78; BP1/3: ES = -0.01 to 0.66). After 10-week of training cessation, the control group declined in all neuromuscular parameters (ES = 0.86-0.92) except in MPV against low loads. Based on these findings, the BPFULL stands as the most effective exercise to maximize neuromuscular improvements in recreational and well-trained athletes compared with partial ROM variations.

J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S57-S65, 2021-This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of a smartphone application (iLOAD) for the monitoring of mean concentric velocity (MV) during resistance training sets. Twenty males completed 2 identical sessions consisting of one set of 10 repetitions against 4 loads (25, 40, 55, 70% of the one repetition maximum [1RM]) during the back squat and bench press exercises. The MV of the 5 initial repetitions and for the whole set were determined simultaneously with the iLOAD application and a linear velocity transducer (LVT). Two independent researchers operated the iLOAD application during the experimental sessions to evaluate the interrater agreement for the assessment of MV. An acceptable but generally lower reliability was observed for iLOAD (coefficient of variation [CV] range: 5.61-9.79%) compared to the LVT (CV range: 4.51-8.18%) at 25-40-55% of 1RM, whereas the reliability at 75% of 1RM was acceptable for the LVT during the bench press (CV range: 6.37-8.26%), but it was unacceptable for the iLOAD during both exercises (CV range: 11.3-12.8%) and for the LVT during the back squat (CV range: 11.3-17.4%). Small to moderate differences (ES range: 0.24-1.04) and very high to practically perfect correlations (r range: 0.70-0.90) were observed between the iLOAD and the LVT. A very high agreement was observed between both raters for the recording of MV during the back squat and bench press exercises (r ≥ 0.98). Taken together, these results suggest that the iLOAD application can be confidently used to quantify the MV of training sets during the squat and bench press exercises not performed to failure.

53,Acute Effects of Ballistic and Non-ballistic Bench Press on Plyometric Push-up Performance.,"Bodden D, Suchomel TJ, Lates A, Anagnost N, Moran MF, Taber CB.","The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a ballistic or non-ballistic concentric-only bench press (COBP) on subsequent plyometric push-up performance. Fourteen resistance trained men completed two separate one-repetition-maximum (1RM) testing sessions followed by three randomized experimental explosive push-up sessions. These sessions combined a heavy concentric bench press with plyometric push-ups. Using a series of 3 × 10 (condition × time) repeated measures ANOVA, comparisons were made between the effects of ballistic and non-ballistic bench presses on performance of plyometric push-ups to investigate push-up performance variables. Compared with the control condition, both ballistic and non-ballistic bench presses produced lower net impulse and take-off velocity data. No differences were found between ballistic and non-ballistic conditions comparing net impulse and take-off velocity. We conclude that the magnitude of loading used in the current investigation may have caused acute fatigue which led to lower push-up performance characteristics. This information can be used to alter loading protocols when designing complexes for the upper body, combining the bench press and plyometric push-ups.

54,Effect of Different Types of Loads on the Force-Velocity Relationship Obtained During the Bench Press Throw Exercise.,"Cosic M, Knezevic OM, Nedeljkovic A, Djuric S, Zivkovic MZ, Garcia-Ramos A.","Cosic, M, Knezevic, OM, Nedeljkovic, A, Djuric, S, Zivkovic, MZ, and Garcia-Ramos, A. Effect of different types of loads on the force-velocity relationship obtained during the bench press throw exercise. J Strength Cond Res 35(9): 2401-2406, 2021-This study aimed (a) to evaluate the degree of linearity of the force-velocity (F-V) relationship across different types of loads, (b) to compare the magnitude of the F-V relationship parameters (maximum values of force [F0], velocity [V0], and power [Pmax]) between the different types of loads, and (c) to explore the concurrent validity of F0 with traditional measures of maximal strength. The F-V relationships of 15 physically active men (age: 20.9 ± 2.0 years, bench press 1 repetition maximum relative to body mass: 1.20 ± 0.10 kg·kg-1) were determined during the bench press throw exercise using predominantly gravitational (W), inertial (I), and combined (W + I) loads. The bench press maximal isometric force (Fiso) and the 1RM were also assessed. The individual F-V relationships were highly linear regardless of the type of load considered (median r [range] = 0.98 [0.94, 1.00]). The W + I load provided the largest value of F0 (972 ± 45 N; 6.0 and 14.6% higher than W and I, respectively), the I load the largest value of V0 (2.99 ± 0.34 m·s-1; 40.4 and 20.1% higher than W and W + I, respectively), and the W load the lowest value of Pmax (501 ± 46 W; -22.7 and -17.1% lower than I and W + I, respectively). The F0 obtained from the W load presented the highest association with Fiso and 1RM values (r > 0.90). The W + I load and the I load should be recommended to work closer to the F0 and V0 capacities, respectively. However, the W load should be recommended to assess maximal strength capacity through the value of F0.

55,Use of Machine-Learning and Load-Velocity Profiling to Estimate 1-Repetition Maximums for Two Variations of the Bench-Press Exercise.,"Balsalobre-Fernández C, Kipp K.","The purpose of the current study was to compare the ability of five different methods to estimate eccentric-concentric and concentric-only bench-press 1RM from load-velocity profile data. Smith machine bench-press tests were performed in an eccentric-concentric (n = 192) and a concentric-only manner (n = 176) while mean concentric velocity was registered using a linear position transducer. Load-velocity profiles were derived from incremental submaximal load (40-80% 1RM) tests. Five different methods were used to calculate 1RM using the slope, intercept, and velocity at 1RM (minimum velocity threshold-MVT) from the load-velocity profiles: calculation with individual MVT, calculation with group average MVT, multilinear regression without MVT, regularized regression without MVT, and an artificial neural network without MVT. Mean average errors for all methods ranged from 2.7 to 3.3 kg. Calculations with individual or group MVT resulted in significant overprediction of eccentric-concentric 1RM (individual MVT: difference = 0.76 kg, p = 0.020, d = 0.17; group MVT: difference = 0.72 kg, p = 0.023, d = 0.17). The multilinear and regularized regression both resulted in the lowest errors and highest correlations. The results demonstrated that bench-press 1RM can be accurately estimated from load-velocity data derived from submaximal loads and without MVT. In addition, results showed that multilinear regression can be used to estimate bench-press 1RM. Collectively, the findings and resulting equations should be helpful for strength and conditioning coaches as they would help estimating 1RM without MVT data.

57,Pulse wave reflection responses to bench press with and without practical blood flow restriction.,"Tai YL, Marshall EM, Glasgow A, Parks JC, Sensibello L, Kingsley JD.","Resistance exercise is recommended to increase muscular strength but may also increase pulse wave reflection. The effect of resistance exercise combined with practical blood flow restriction (pBFR) on pulse wave reflection is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in pulse wave reflection characteristics between bench press with pBFR and traditional high-load bench press in resistance-trained men. Sixteen resistance-trained men participated in the study. Pulse wave reflection characteristics were assessed before and after low-load bench press with pBFR (LL-pBFR), traditional high-load bench press (HL), and a control (CON). A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in pulse wave reflection characteristics among the conditions across time. There were significant (p ≤ 0.05) interactions for heart rate, augmentation index, augmentation index normalized at 75 bpm, augmentation pressure, time-tension index, and wasted left ventricular energy such that they were increased after LL-pBFR and HL compared with rest and CON, with no differences between LL-pBFR and HL. Aortic pulse pressure (p < 0.001) was elevated only after LL-pBFR compared with rest. In addition, there was a significant (p ≤ 0.05) interaction for aortic diastolic blood pressure (BP) such that it was decreased after LL-pBFR compared with rest and CON but not HL. The subendocardial viability ratio and diastolic pressure-time index were significantly different between LL-pBFR and HL compared with rest and CON. There were no significant interactions for brachial systolic or diastolic BP, aortic systolic BP, or time of the reflected wave. In conclusion, acute bench press resistance exercise significantly altered pulse wave reflection characteristics without differences between LL-pBFR and HL.

58,Effect of creatine supplementation during resistance training on lean tissue mass and muscular strength in older adults: a meta-analysis.,"Chilibeck PD, Kaviani M, Candow DG, Zello GA.","The loss of muscle mass and strength with aging results in significant functional impairment. Creatine supplementation has been used in combination with resistance training as a strategy for increasing lean tissue mass and muscle strength in older adults, but results across studies are equivocal. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of creatine supplementation during resistance training in older adults with lean tissue mass, chest press strength, and leg press strength as outcomes by searching PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases. Twenty-two studies were included in our meta-analysis with 721 participants (both men and women; with a mean age of 57-70 years across studies) randomized to creatine supplementation or placebo during resistance training 2-3 days/week for 7-52 weeks. Creatine supplementation resulted in greater increases in lean tissue mass (mean difference =1.37 kg [95% CI =0.97-1.76]; p<0.00001), chest press strength (standardized mean difference [SMD] =0.35 [0.16-0.53]; p=0.0002), and leg press strength (SMD =0.24 [0.05-0.43]; p=0.01). A number of mechanisms exist by which creatine may increase lean tissue mass and muscular strength. These are included in a narrative review in the discussion section of this article. In summary, creatine supplementation increases lean tissue mass and upper and lower body muscular strength during resistance training of older adults, but potential mechanisms by which creatine exerts these positive effects have yet to be evaluated extensively.

59,Using bench press load to predict upper body exercise loads in physically active individuals.,"Wong del P, Ngo KL, Tse MA, Smith AW.","This study investigated whether loads for assistance exercises of the upper body can be predicted from the loads of the bench press exercise. Twenty-nine physically active collegiate students (age: 22.6 ± 2.5; weight training experience: 2.9 ± 2.1 years; estimated 1RM bench press: 54.31 ± 14.60 kg; 1RM: body weight ratio: 0.80 ± 0.22; BMI: 22.7 ± 2.1 kg·m(-2)) were recruited. The 6RM loads for bench press, barbell bicep curl, overhead dumbbell triceps extension, hammer curl and dumbbell shoulder press were measured. Test-retest reliability for the 5 exercises as determined by Pearson product moment correlation coefficient was very high to nearly perfect (0.82-0.98, p < 0.01). The bench press load was significantly correlated with the loads of the 4 assistance exercises (r ranged from 0.80 to 0.93, p < 0.01). Linear regression revealed that the bench press load was a significant (R(2) range from 0.64 to 0.86, p < 0.01) predictor for the loads of the 4 assistance exercises. The following 6RM prediction equations were determined: (a) Hammer curl = Bench press load (0.28) + 6.30 kg, (b) Barbell biceps curl = Bench press load (0.33) + 6.20 kg, (c) Overhead triceps extension = Bench press load (0.33) - 0.60 kg, and (d) Dumbbell shoulder press = Bench press load (0.42) + 5.84 kg. The difference between the actual load and the predicted load using the four equations ranged between 6.52% and 8.54%, such difference was not significant. Fitness professionals can use the 6RM bench press load as a time effective and accurate method to predict training loads for upper body assistance exercises. Key pointsThe bench press load was significantly correlated with the loads of the 4 assistance exercises.No significant differences were found between the actual load and the predicted load in the four equations.6RM bench press load can be a time effective and accurate method to predict training loads for upper body assistance exercises.

60,Bench Press Upper-Body Muscle Activation Between Stable and Unstable Loads.,"Dunnick DD, Brown LE, Coburn JW, Lynn SK, Barillas SR.","The bench press is one of the most commonly used upper-body exercises in training and is performed with many different variations, including unstable loads (ULs). Although there is much research on use of an unstable surface, there is little to none on the use of an UL. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle activation during the bench press while using a stable load (SL) vs. UL. Twenty resistance-trained men (age = 24.1 ± 2 years; ht = 177.5 ± 5.8 cm; mass = 88.7 ± 13.7 kg) completed 2 experimental conditions (SL and UL) at 2 different intensities (60 and 80% one repetition maximum). Unstable load was achieved by hanging 16 kg kettlebells by elastic bands from the end of the bar. All trial lifts were set to a 2-second cadence with a slight pause at the bottom. Subjects had electrodes attached to 5 muscles (pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, medial deltoid, triceps brachii, and latissimus dorsi) and performed 3 isometric bench press trials to normalize electromyographic data. All 5 muscles demonstrated significantly greater activation at 80% compared with 60% load and during concentric compared with eccentric actions. These results suggest that upper body muscle activation is not different in the bench press between UL and SL. Therefore, coaches should use their preference when designing training programs.

61,Neuromuscular Control During the Bench Press Movement in an Elite Disabled and Able-Bodied Athlete.,"Gołaś A, Zwierzchowska A, Maszczyk A, Wilk M, Stastny P, Zając A.","The disabled population varies significantly in regard to physical fitness, what is conditioned by the damage to the locomotor system. Recently there has been an increased emphasis on the role of competitive sport in enhancing health and the quality of life of individuals with disability. One of the sport disciplines of Paralympics is the flat bench press. The bench press is one of the most popular resistance exercises used for the upper body in healthy individuals. It is used not only by powerlifters, but also by athletes in most strength-speed oriented sport disciplines. The objective of the study was to compare neuromuscular control for various external loads (from 60 to 100% 1RM) during the flat bench press performed by an elite able-bodied athlete and an athlete with lower limb disability. The research project is a case study of two elite bench press athletes with similar sport results: an able-bodied athlete (M.W., age 34 years, body mass 103 kg, body height 1.72 m, 1RM in the flat bench press 200 kg) and a disabled athlete (M.T., age 31 years, body mass 92 kg, body height 1.70 m, 1RM in the flat bench press 190 kg). The activity was recorded for four muscles: pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), as well as for the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii (TBlat and TBlong). The T-test revealed statistically significant differences between peak activity of all the considered muscles (AD with p = 0.001; PM with p = 0.001; TBlat with p = 0.0021 and TBlong with p = 0.002) between the 2 athletes. The analysis of peak activity differences of M.W and M.T. in relation to the load revealed statistically significant differences for load changes between: 60 to 100% 1RM (p = 0.007), 70 to 100% 1RM (p = 0.016) and 80 to 100% 1RM (p = 0.032). The flat bench press performed without legs resting firmly on the ground leads to the increased engagement of upper body muscles and to their greater activation. Isolated initial positions can be used to generate greater engagement of muscle groups during the bench press exercise and evoke their higher activation.

62,The Acute Effect of Accentuated Eccentric Overloading upon the Kinematics and Myoelectric Activity in the Eccentric and Concentric Phase of a Traditional Bench Press.,"Kristiansen EL, Larsen S, van den Tillaar R.","The target of this study was to investigate the acute effect of a supramaximal augmented eccentric load on the kinematics and myoelectric activity during the concentric phase of the lift in a traditional bench press. Ten resistance-trained males (age 24 ± 6.4 years, height 1.80 ± 0.07 m, body-mass 87.2 ± 16.9 kg) performed two repetitions at 110/85% of the 1-RM in the dynamic accentuated external resistance (DAER) group and two repetitions at 85/85% of the 1-RM for the control group in a traditional bench press. The barbell kinematics, joint kinematics and myoelectric activity of eight muscles were measured in the eccentric phase and the pre-sticking, sticking and post-sticking regions. The main findings were that the sticking region started at a lower barbell height and that a lower barbell velocity was observed in the sticking region during the second repetition in the DAER condition compared to the control condition. Additionally, the lateral deltoid muscle and clavicle part of the pectoralis were more active during the eccentric loading compared to the control condition for the second repetition. Furthermore, higher myoelectric activity was measured during the second repetition in the sticking region for the eccentric loading condition in both pectoralis muscles, while the sternal parts of the pectoralis and anterior deltoid were more active during the second repetition of the control condition in the post-sticking region. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that the supramaximal loading in the descending phase with 110% of the 1-RM in the bench press does not have an acute and positive effect of enhanced performance in the ascending phase of the lift at 85% of 1-RM. Instead, fatigue occurs when using this eccentric load during a bench press.

Relationship of barbell and dumbbell repetitions with one repetition maximum bench press in college football players. J Strength Cond Res 35(2S): S66-S71, 2021-Dumbbell training to augment barbell training is gaining popularity. However, information is lacking that details the compatibility of strength and endurance between dumbbell and barbell performances in the same exercise. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to compare the similarity of muscular endurance performance between dumbbell and barbell exercises and to assess the accuracy of predicting one repetition maximum (1RM) barbell bench press from barbell and dumbbell repetitions to fatigue (RTF). College football players (n = 40) performed 1RM barbell bench press and RTF with a 90.9-kg barbell. On separate days, unilateral (45.5 kg) and bilateral dumbbell (90.9 kg) RTF were performed. Barbell RTF (13.8 ± 9.2) were significantly greater (effect size [ES] = 0.14) than bilateral dumbbell RTF (12.5 ± 9.5) but highly correlated (r = 0.96). Unilateral dumbbell RTF were significantly greater (ES = 0.13) for dominant hand (10.8 ± 10.1) than nondominant hand (9.5 ± 9.7) but highly correlated (r = 0.97). Prediction of 1RM barbell bench press was equally effective using a constant weight barbell (r = 0.90) or equivalent weight bilateral dumbbells (r = 0.87) with total errors of 7.3 and 8.2%, respectively. Barbell and dumbbell repetitions with equivalent weights place a similar demand on the upper-body musculature for training and testing purposes in football athletes.

64,Creatine monohydrate supplementation during eight weeks of progressive resistance training increases strength in as little as two weeks without reducing markers of muscle damage.,"Kaviani M, Abassi A, Chilibeck PD.","Background:
        
      
      Creatine supplementation (Cr) increases strength during resistance training, but the time course of this strength increase is unclear. The aim was to determine the precise time course by which Cr could increase strength and whether Cr prevents muscle damage during eight weeks of resistance training.
Methods:
        
      
      Young males were randomized (double blind) to Cr (N.=9, 0.07g/kg/d) and placebo (N.=9) during 8-weeks of resistance training (3 d/week). Strength was assessed across six exercises every two weeks. Venous blood samples obtained at baseline, and 24 and 48 hours after the final resistance training session were assessed for creatine kinase [CK] and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] as measures of muscle damage.
Results:
        
      
      Strength was significantly higher in the Cr versus placebo group (P<0.05) after two weeks of training for three of the six exercises (bench press, leg press, shoulder press). By the end of the eight weeks of training, strength was significantly higher in the Cr versus placebo group (P<0.05) for four of the six exercises (bench press, leg press, shoulder press, and triceps extension, but not biceps curl or lat-pulldown). Creatine supplementation did not prevent muscle damage. Indeed, muscle damage markers increased in the Cr compared to placebo group (P<0.05).
Conclusions:
        
      
      Cr increased muscular strength in as little as two weeks during a resistance training program; however, this was not accompanied by decreased muscle damage. Greater muscle damage with Cr may be due to a greater training intensity enabled by Cr supplementation. This might lead to greater protein turnover and enhanced muscle adaptation.

65,Effects of Acute Caffeine Intake on Power Output and Movement Velocity During a Multiple-Set Bench Press Exercise Among Mild Caffeine Users.,"Filip-Stachnik A, Krzysztofik M, Kaszuba M, Leznicka K, Kostrzewa M, Del Coso J, Wilk M.","The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an acute dose of caffeine (6 mg/kg body mass (b.m.)) on power output and bar velocity during a bench press multiple-set resistance training session in participants with mild daily caffeine consumption (in the range of 1 to 3 mg/kg/b.m). Thirteen recreationally active male participants (age: 21.9 ± 1.2 years, body mass: 74.4 ± 5.3 kg, body mass index: 23.1 ± 1.6 kg/m2, bench press onerepetition maximum (1RM): 79.2 ± 14.9 kg), with daily caffeine ingestion of 1.56 ± 0.56 mg/kg/b.m., participated in the study with a randomized double-blind experimental design. Each participant performed two identical experimental sessions, 60 min after the intake of a placebo (PLAC) or 6 mg/kg/b.m. of caffeine (CAF-6). In each experimental session, participants performed 5 sets of 5 repetitions of the bench press exercise with a load equivalent to 70% 1RM. The eccentric and concentric phases of the bench press exercise were performed at maximal possible velocity in each repetition. Bar velocity was recorded with a linear position transducer and power output was calculated using velocity and load data. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated no significant substance x set interaction for mean power output (MP), mean bar velocity (MV), peak power output (PP) and peak bar velocity (PV). However, there was a significant main effect of substance on MP (p < 0.01; η2 = 0.47) and MV (p < 0.01; η2 =0.45). Post hoc analysis for main effect revealed that MP and MV values in the CAF-6 group were higher than in the PLAC group in all 5 sets of the exercise (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that an acute dose of caffeine before resistance exercise increased mean power output and mean bar velocity during a multiple-set bench press exercise protocol among mild caffeine users.

Ten resistance-trained healthy males with at least six-year experience in resistance training (27.7 ± 5.6 years, 81.1 ± 5.8 kg and 175.3 ± 5.2 cm, bench press one-repetition maximum [1RM] = 98.9 ± 7.1 kg) performed the bench press at 50% and at 90%1RM. The differences in peak sEMG amplitude between body-sides and the external loads were recorded for the pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), and the long head of the triceps brachii (TB) during each attempt. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed statistically significant main effect of side for AD (p < 0.001) and TB (p < 0.001) but not for PM (p = 0.168) and a significant main effect of load for TB (p < 0.001) but not for AD and PM (p = 0.229; p = 0.072; respectively). The post-hoc analysis for the main effect of side showed significantly higher peak sEMG amplitude for the dominant side compared to the non-dominant side for AD and TB at 50%1RM and 90%1RM (p < 0.001; all) with no statistically significant differences for PM (p = 0.187; p = 0.155; both loads). The post-hoc analysis for the main effect of load for TB revealed a significantly higher peak sEMG amplitude at 90%1RM compared to the 50%1RM (p = 0.009). The obtained results indicate that regardless of the external load, the peak sEMG activity of the AD, PM, and TB during the bench press exercise performed to muscular failure was higher on the dominant body-side.

Using a double-blinded, counterbalanced, crossover study design, subjects were supplemented with either 70 ml of BRJ or placebo (PL; black currant juice) 2 hours before exercise. During each exercise trial, subjects began by completing 2 sets × 2 repetitions of bench press at 70% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) with maximum explosive intent. Barbell velocity and power were measured using a linear position transducer. Subjects then completed 3 sets × RTF at 70% 1RM separated by 2 minutes of rest between each set. Maximum mean power, velocity, and repetitions were analyzed. Mean velocity (p = 0.011; effect size [ES] = 0.54) and mean power (p = 0.015; ES = 0.51) were significantly higher with BRJ when compared with PL. Total RTF (p = 0.002; ES = 0.46) was higher during the BRJ condition vs. PL. Results indicate that acute BRJ supplementation positively impacts velocity, power, and total repetitions during free-weight bench press exercise.

68,Relationship of pectoralis major muscle size with bench press and bench throw performances.,"Akagi R, Tohdoh Y, Hirayama K, Kobayashi Y.","This study examined the relationship of muscle size indices of the pectoralis major muscle with bench press and bench throw performances in 18 male collegiate athletes. The maximal cross-sectional area (MCSAMAx) and volume (MV) of the pectoralis major muscle were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. First, subjects were tested for their one repetition maximum bench press strength (1RMBP) using a Smith machine. At a later date, subjects performed bench throws using the Smith machine with several different loads ranging from 30.0 kg to 90% of 1RMBP. Barbell positions were measured by a linear position transducer, and bench throw power was calculated using a dynamic equation. Three trials were performed for each load. In all the trials, the maximal peak power was adopted as bench throw peak power (PPBT). The 1RMBP was significantly correlated with MCSAMAx. Similarly, the correlation coefficient between MV and PPBT was significant. In contrast to the y-intercept of the MV-PPBT regression line, that of the MCSAMAx-1RMBP regression line was not significantly different from 0. These results suggested that, although the dependence on pectoralis major muscle size is slightly different between bench press strength and bench throw power, the pectoralis major muscle size has a significant impact on bench press and throw performances. Greater muscle size leads to heavier body weight, which can be a negative factor in some sports. We therefore recommend that athletes and their coaches develop training programs for improving sports performance by balancing the advantage of increased muscle size and the potential disadvantage of increased body weight.

Comparison between bench press throw and ballistic push-up tests to assess upper-body power in trained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 32(6): 1503-1510, 2018-The purpose of this study was to validate the ballistic push-up (BPU) test performed with hands on a force plate as a method to measure upper-body power. Twenty-eight experienced resistance-trained men (age = 25.4 ± 5.2 years; body mass = 78.5 ± 9.0 kg; body height = 179.6 ± 7.8 cm) performed, 2 days apart, a bench press 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test and upper-body power tests. Mean power (MP) and peak power (PP) were assessed using the bench press throw (BT) test and the BPU test performed in randomized order. The area under the force/power curve (AUC) obtained at BT was also calculated. Power expressed at BPU was estimated using a time-based prediction equation. Mean force and the participant's body weight were used to predict the bench press 1RM. Pearson product-moment correlations were used to examine relationships between the power assessment methods and between the predicted 1RM bench and the actual value. Large correlations (0.79; p < 0.001) were found between AUC and MP expressed at BPU. Large correlations were also detected between MP and PP expressed at BT and BPU (0.75; p < 0.001 and 0.74; p < 0.001, respectively). Very large correlations (0.87; p < 0.001) were found between the 1RM bench and the 1RM predicted by the BPU. Results of this study indicate that BPU represents a valid and reliable method to estimate the upper-body power in resistance-trained individuals.

70,Differences in motivation during the bench press movement with progressive loads using EEG analysis.,"Maszczyk A, Dobrakowski P, Żak M, Gozdowski P, Krawczyk M, Małecki A, Stastny P, Zajac T.","Considering our preliminary research with EEG analysis of the bench press in experienced powerlifters, we hypothesized that there would be significant differences in motivation between novice and elite powerlifters. Therefore the main objective of this study was to identify patterns of frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) of the prime movers by alpha frequency band analysis (named as alpha motivation values) for each 35-100% one-repetition maximum (1RM) during the flat bench press. Ten novice powerlifters with no more than 2.5 years of resistance training experience and ten elite powerlifters with at least 7.5 years of training experience participated in the study. All participants were required to squat, bench press, and deadlift 100, 125, and 150% of their body mass, respectively. The athletes constituted a homogeneous group with respect to age (mean 22.3 ± 0.5 years). The EEG recordings were conducted using automatic headcups with 19 electrodes that were placed according to the International 10-20 Electrode Placement System. Signals from 8-12 Hz considering points F3 and F4 were analyzed. Furthermore, electromyographic (EMG) signals from the trapezius muscle were recorded. Before testing, moods and emotions of subjects were assessed to eliminate subjects with intense emotions. The results showed brain activity before, during and after cognitive and motor performance using electroencephalography (EEG). However, considering the still existing problems of movement artefacts during EEG measurements, eligible sports and exercises are limited to those that are relatively motionless during execution. Further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

71,"Acute Effects of High Doses of Caffeine on Bar Velocity during the Bench Press Throw in Athletes Habituated to Caffeine: A Randomized, Double-Blind and Crossover Study.","Filip-Stachnik A, Krzysztofik M, Del Coso J, Wilk M.","Chronic intake of caffeine may produce a reduction in the potential performance benefits obtained with the acute intake of this substance. For this reason, athletes habituated to caffeine often use high doses of caffeine (≥9 mg/kg) to overcome tolerance to caffeine ergogenicity due to chronic intake. The main objective of the current investigation was to evaluate the effects of high caffeine doses on bar velocity during an explosive bench press throw in athletes habituated to caffeine. Twelve resistance-trained athletes, with a moderate-to-high chronic intake of caffeine (~5.3 mg/kg/day) participated in a randomized double-blind and randomized experimental design. Each participant performed three identical experimental sessions 60 min after the intake of a placebo (PLAC) or after the intake of 9 (CAF-9) or 12 mg/kg (CAF-12) of caffeine. In each experimental session, the athletes performed five sets of two repetitions of the bench press throw exercise with a load equivalent to 30% of their one-repetition maximum. In comparison to PLAC, the intake of caffeine increased peak and mean velocity (p < 0.01) during the five sets of the bench press throw exercise. There were no significant differences in peak and mean bar velocity between the two doses of caffeine (CAF-9 vs. CAF-12; p = 0.91, = 0.96, respectively). The ingestion of high doses of caffeine was effective in producing an increase in mean and peak bar velocity during the bench press throw in a group of habitual caffeine users. However, using CAF-12 did not offer additional benefits for performance with respect to CAF-9.

72,Elbow joint fatigue and bench-press training.,"Huang YP, Chou YL, Chen FC, Wang RT, Huang MJ, Chou PP.","Context:
        
      
      Bench-press exercises are among the most common form of training exercise for the upper extremity because they yield a notable improvement in both muscle strength and muscle endurance. The literature contains various investigations into the effects of different bench-press positions on the degree of muscle activation. However, the effects of fatigue on the muscular performance and kinetics of the elbow joint are not understood fully.
Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the effects of fatigue on the kinetics and myodynamic performance of the elbow joint in bench-press training.
Design:
        
      
      Controlled laboratory study.
Setting:
        
      
      Motion research laboratory.
Patients or other participants:
        
      
      A total of 18 physically healthy male students (age = 19.6 ± 0.8 years, height = 168.7 ± 5.5 cm, mass = 69.6 ± 8.6 kg) participated in the investigation. All participants were right-hand dominant, and none had a history of upper extremity injuries or disorders.
Intervention(s):
        
      
      Participants performed bench-press training until fatigued.
Main outcome measure(s):
        
      
      Maximal possible number of repetitions, cycle time, myodynamic decline rate, elbow-joint force, and elbow-joint moment.
Results:
        
      
      We observed a difference in cycle time in the initial (2.1 ± 0.42 seconds) and fatigue (2.58 ± 0.46 seconds) stages of the bench-press exercise (P = .04). As the participants fatigued, we observed an increase in the medial-lateral force (P = .03) and internal-external moment (P ≤ .04) acting on the elbow joint. Moreover, a reduction in the elbow muscle strength was observed in the elbow extension-flexion (P ≤ .003) and forearm supination-pronation (P ≤ .001) conditions.
Conclusions:
        
      
      The results suggest that performing bench-press exercises to the point of fatigue increases elbow-joint loading and may further increase the risk of injury. Therefore, when clinicians design bench-press exercise regimens for general athletic training, muscle strengthening, or physical rehabilitation, they should control carefully the maximal number of repetitions.

73,Effect of Barbell Weight on the Structure of the Flat Bench Press.,"Król H, Gołaś A.","Król, H and Gołaś, A. Effect of barbell weight on the structure of the flat bench press. J Strength Cond Res 31(5): 1321-1337, 2017-In this study, we have used the multimodular measuring system SMART. The system consisted of 6 infrared cameras and a wireless module to measure muscle bioelectric activity. In addition, the path of the barbell was measured with a special device called the pantograph. Our study concerns the change in the structure of the flat bench press when the weight of the barbell is increased. The research on the bench press technique included both the causes of the motion: the internal structure of the movement and the external kinematic structure showing the effects of the motion, i.e., all the characteristics of the movement. Twenty healthy, male recreational weight trainers with at least 1 year of lifting experience (the mean ± SD = 3.3 ± 1.6 years) were recruited for this study. The subjects had a mean body mass of 80.2 ± 8.6 kg, an average height of 1.77 ± 0.08 m, and their average age was 24.7 ± 0.9 years. In the measuring session, the participants performed consecutive sets of a single repetition of bench pressing with an increasing load (about 70, 80, 90, and 100% of their 1 repetition maximum [1RM]). The results showed a significant change in the phase structure of the bench press, as the barbell weight was increased. While doing the bench press at a 100% 1RM load, the pectoralis major changes from being the prime mover to being the supportive prime mover. At the same time, the role of the prime mover is taken on by the deltoideus anterior. The triceps brachii, in particular, clearly shows a greater involvement.

74,The Effects of Augmented Eccentric Loading upon Kinematics and Muscle Activation in Bench Press Performance.,"van den Tillaar R, Kwan K.","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an augmented eccentric load upon the kinematics and muscle activation of bench press, and to investigate possible mechanisms behind augmented eccentric loading during the lift. Sixteen resistance-trained males (age 28.5 ± 7.7 years, height 1.78 ± 0.08 m, body mass 80.7 ± 14.3 kg) performed three repetitions at 95/85% of 1RM (augmented eccentric loading), and 85/85% of 1RM (control) in bench press, while barbell kinematics and muscle activation of eight muscles were measured. The main findings were that no kinematic differences between the augmented and control condition were found, only an effect of repetition. Furthermore, augmented loading caused a higher activation of the biceps brachii during the pre-sticking and sticking region, while a lower activation in the sternal part of pectoralis major during the eccentric phase was observed. Based on the present findings, it can be concluded that augmented eccentric loading with 95% of 1RM in bench press did not have any acute positive effect upon the concentric phase of the lift (85% of 1RM) and that the proposed underlying mechanisms like potentiation, increased neural stimulation and preload, and recovery of stored elastic energy does not seem to occur with these loads.

75,"Time course of recovery is similar for the back squat, bench press, and deadlift in well-trained males.","Belcher DJ, Sousa CA, Carzoli JP, Johnson TK, Helms ER, Visavadiya NP, Zoeller RF, Whitehurst M, Zourdos MC.","This study examined the time course of recovery following resistance exercise sessions in the back squat, bench press, and deadlift. Twelve well-trained males (age: 24.5 ± 3.8 years, body mass: 84.01 ± 15.44 kg, training age: 7.1 ± 4.2 years) performed 4 sets to failure at 80% of a 1-repetition maximum (1RM) on the squat, bench press, and deadlift in successive weeks. The bench press was always performed in week 2 with the squat and deadlift order counterbalanced between weeks 1 and 3. Indirect muscle damage and performance fatigue was assessed immediately before and after exercise and at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h postexercise. Outcome measures included limb swelling, joint range of motion, delayed onset muscle soreness, average concentric velocity (ACV) at 70% of 1RM, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Most measures demonstrated a main time effect (p < 0.05) within conditions; however, no between condition (p > 0.05) differences existed. ACV decreased in the squat condition for up to 72 h (p = 0.02, -8.61%) and in the bench press (p < 0.01, -26.69%) immediately postexercise but did not decline during the deadlift condition (p > 0.05). There was a main time effect for increased cfDNA in the squat (p < 0.01) and bench press (p < 0.05), but not the deadlift (p = 0.153). Further, immediately postexercise increases in cfDNA were directly related (p < 0.05) to changes in ACV in all 3 conditions. These results suggest that the deadlift does not result in greater muscle damage and recovery time than the squat and bench press following volume-type training in well-trained men. Further, acute changes in cfDNA may predict performance during the recovery period.

The effects of superset configuration on kinetic, kinematic, and perceived exertion in the barbell bench press. J Strength Cond Res 34(1): 65-72, 2020-Training that is efficient and effective is of great importance to an athlete. One method of improving efficiency is by incorporating supersets into resistance training routines. However, the structuring of supersets is still unexplored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of agonist-antagonist (A-A), alternate peripheral (A-P), and similar biomechanical (SB) superset configurations on rate of perceived exertion (RPE), kinetic and kinematic changes during the bench press. Ten subjects performed resistance training protocols in a randomized-crossover design, with magnitude-based inferences assessing changes/differences within and between protocols. Changes in rate of perceived exertion were very likely and almost certainly greater in the A-P and SB protocols when compared with the A-A, whereas all superset protocols had very likely to almost certain reductions in mean velocity and power from baseline. Reductions in mean velocity and power were almost certainly greater in the SB protocol, with differences between the A-A and A-P protocols being unclear. Decreases in peak force were likely and almost certain in the A-A and SB protocols respectively, with changes in A-P being unclear. Differences between these protocols showed likely greater decreases in SB peak forces when compared to A-A, with all other superset comparisons being unclear. This study demonstrates the importance of exercise selection when incorporating supersets into a training routine. It is suggested that the practitioner uses A-A supersets when aiming to improve training efficiency and minimize reductions in kinetic and kinematic output of the agonist musculature while completing the barbell bench press.

Twenty-seven resistance-trained men were divided into three groups according to their prime mover activity, as measured by surface electromyography during a bench press (BP). Each group underwent a six-week block of targeted exercises for one of the following muscles: anterior deltoid (AD), pectoralis major (PM) or triceps brachii (TB). ANOVA showed that each group increased their 1 repetition maximum (1RM) (p < 0.05) and the activity of the exercised muscle group during an isometric bench press (p < 0.01) and during a dynamic bench press (p < 0.01) at 85% of the 1RM. During the isometric BP, the TB training group had an increase in TB activity in comparison to the other groups. Targeted muscle training is a useful method for muscle activity increase and increasing the maximum strength in complex exercise, when applied in activity-deficient muscle groups. Strengthening the TB elicits changes in all prime movers and results in TB activity domination during a bench press.

78,Validity and Reliability of Kinematics Measured with PUSH Band vs. Linear Encoder in Bench Press and Push-Ups.,"van den Tillaar R, Ball N.","Background:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to compare the validity and reliability of a PUSH band device with a linear encoder to measure movement velocity with different loads during the push-up and bench press exercises.
Methods:
        
      
      Twenty resistance-trained athletes performed push-up and bench press exercises with four different loads: without weight vest, 10-20-30 kg weight vest, bench press: 50-82% of their assumed 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) in steps of 10 kg. A linear encoder (Musclelab) and the PUSH band measured mean and peak velocity during both exercises. Several statistical analyses were used to investigate the validity and reliability of the PUSH band with the linear encoder.
Results:
        
      
      The main findings of this study demonstrated only moderate associations between the PUSH band and linear encoder for mean velocity (r = 0.62, 0.70) and peak velocity (r = 0.46, 0.49) for both exercises. Furthermore, a good level of agreement (peak velocity: ICC = 0.60, 0.64; mean velocity: ICC = 0.77, 0.78) was observed between the two measurement devices. However, a significant bias was found with lower velocity values measured with the PUSH band in both exercises. In the push-up, both the linear encoder and PUSH band were deemed very reliable (ICC > 0.98; the coefficient of variation (CV): 5.9-7.3%). Bench press reliability decreased for the PUSH band (ICC < 0.95), and the coefficient of variance increased to (12.8-13.3%) for the velocity measures. Calculated 1 RM with the two devices was the same for the push-up, while in bench press the PUSH band under-estimated the 1 RM by 14 kg compared to the linear encoder.
Conclusions:
        
      
      It was concluded that the PUSH band will show decreased reliability from velocity measures in a bench press exercise and underestimate load-velocity based 1 RM predictions. For training, the PUSH band can be used during push-ups, however caution is suggested when using the device for the purposes of feedback in bench press at increasing loads.

79,Effects of an active warm-up on variation in bench press and back squat (upper and lower body measures).,"Pullinger S, Robertson CM, Oakley AJ, Hobbs R, Hughes M, Burniston JG, Edwards BJ.","The present study investigated the magnitude of diurnal variation in back squat and bench press using the MuscleLab linear encoder over three different loads and assessed the benefit of an active warm-up to establish whether diurnal variation could be negated. Ten resistance-trained males underwent (mean ± SD: age 21.0 ± 1.3 years, height 1.77 ± 0.06 m, and body mass 82.8 ± 14.9 kg) three sessions. These included control morning (M, 07:30 h) and evening (E, 17:30 h) sessions (5-min standardized warm-up at 150 W, on a cycle ergometer), and one further session consisting of an extended active warm-up morning trial (ME, 07:30 h) until rectal temperature (Trec) reached previously recorded resting evening levels (at 150 W, on a cycle ergometer). All sessions included handgrip, followed by a defined program of bench press (at 20, 40, and 60 kg) and back squat (at 30, 50, and 70 kg) exercises. A linear encoder was attached to an Olympic bar used for the exercises and average force (AF), peak velocity (PV), and time to peak velocity (tPV) were measured (MuscleLab software; MuscleLab Technology, Langesund, Norway) during the concentric phase of the movements. Values for Trec were higher in the E session compared to values in the M session (Δ0.53 °C, P < 0.0005). Following the extended active warm-up in the morning (ME), Trec and Tm values were no different to the E values (P < 0.05). Values for Tm were lower in the M compared to the E condition throughout (P < 0.05). There were time-of-day effects for hand grip with higher values of 6.49% for left (P = 0.05) and 4.61% for right hand (P = 0.002) in the E compared to the M. Daily variations were apparent for both bench press and back squat performance for AF (3.28% and 2.63%), PV (13.64% and 11.50%), and tPV (-16.97% and -14.12%, where a negative number indicates a decrease in the variable from morning to evening). There was a main effect for load (P < 0.0005) such that AF and PV values were larger at higher masses on the bar than lower ones and tPV was smaller at lower masses on the bar than at higher masses for both bench press and back squat. We established that increasing Trec in the M-E values did not result in an increase of any measures related to bench press and back squat performance (P > 0.05) to increase from M to E levels. Therefore, MuscleLab linear encoder could detect meaningful differences between the morning and evening for all variables. However, the diurnal variation in bench press and back squat (measures of lower and upper body force and power output) is not explained by time-of-day oscillations in Trec.

80,Acute Effects of Continuous and Intermittent Blood Flow Restriction on Movement Velocity During Bench Press Exercise Against Different Loads.,"Wilk M, Gepfert M, Krzysztofik M, Stastny P, Zajac A, Bogdanis GC.","This study evaluated the effects of continuous and intermittent blood flow restriction (BFR) with 70% of full arterial occlusion pressure on bar velocity during the bench press exercise against a wide range of resistive loads. Eleven strength-trained males (age: 23.5 ± 1.4 years; resistance training experience: 2.8 ± 0.8 years, maximal bench press strength - 1RM = 101.8 ± 13.9 kg; body mass = 79.8 ± 10.4 kg), performed three different testing protocols in random and counterbalanced order: without BFR (NO-BFR); intermittent BFR (I-BFR) and continuous BFR (C-BFR). During each experimental session, subjects performed eight sets of two repetitions each, with increasing loads from 20 to 90% 1RM (10% steps), and 3 min rest between each set. In the C-BFR condition occlusion was kept throughout the trial, while in the I-BFR, occlusion was released during each 3 min rest interval. Peak bar velocity (PV) during the bench press exercise was higher by 12-17% in both I-BFR and C-BFR compared with NO-BFR only at the loads of 20, 30, 40, and 50% 1RM (p < 0.001), while performance at higher loads remained unchanged. Mean bar velocity (MV) was unaffected by occlusion (p = 0.342). These results indicate that BFR during bench press exercise increases PV and this may be used as an enhanced stimulus during explosive resistance training. At higher workloads, bench press performance was not negatively affected by BFR, indicating that the benefits of exercise under occlusion can be obtained while explosive performance is not impaired.

81,Muscle synergies during bench press are reliable across days.,"Kristiansen M, Samani A, Madeleine P, Hansen EA.","Muscle synergies have been investigated during different types of human movement using nonnegative matrix factorization. However, there are not any reports available on the reliability of the method. To evaluate between-day reliability, 21 subjects performed bench press, in two test sessions separated by approximately 7days. The movement consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions at 60% of the three repetition maximum in bench press. Muscle synergies were extracted from electromyography data of 13 muscles, using nonnegative matrix factorization. To evaluate between-day reliability, we performed a cross-correlation analysis and a cross-validation analysis, in which the synergy components extracted in the first test session were recomputed, using the fixed synergy components from the second test session. Two muscle synergies accounted for >90% of the total variance, and reflected the concentric and eccentric phase, respectively. The cross-correlation values were strong to very strong (r-values between 0.58 and 0.89), while the cross-validation values ranged from substantial to almost perfect (ICC3, 1 values between 0.70 and 0.95). The present findings revealed that the same general structure of the muscle synergies was present across days and the extraction of muscle synergies is thus deemed reliable.

82,Bench press and push-up at comparable levels of muscle activity results in similar strength gains.,"Calatayud J, Borreani S, Colado JC, Martin F, Tella V, Andersen LL.","Electromyography (EMG) exercise evaluation is commonly used to measure the intensity of muscle contraction. Although researchers assume that biomechanically comparable resistance exercises with similar high EMG levels will produce similar strength gains over the long term, no studies have actually corroborated this hypothesis. This study evaluated EMG levels during 6 repetition maximum (6RM) bench press and push-up, and subsequently performed a 5-week training period where subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups (i.e., 6RM bench press group, 6RM elastic band push-up group, or control group) to evaluate muscle strength gains. Thirty university students with advanced resistance training experience participated in the 2-part study. During the training period, exercises were performed using the same loads and variables that were used during the EMG data collection. At baseline, EMG amplitude showed no significant difference between 6RM bench press and band push-up. Significant differences among the groups were found for percent change (Δ) between pretest and posttest for 6RM (p = 0.017) and for 1 repetition maximum (1RM) (p < 0.001). Six repetition maximum bench press group and 6RM elastic band push-up group improved their 1RM and 6RM (Δ ranging from 13.65 to 22.21) tests significantly with similar gains, whereas control group remains unchanged. Thus, when the EMG values are comparable and the same conditions are reproduced, the aforementioned exercises can provide similar muscle strength gains.

83,Caffeine ingestion acutely enhances muscular strength and power but not muscular endurance in resistance-trained men.,"Grgic J, Mikulic P.","The goal of this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was to assess the acute effects of caffeine ingestion on muscular strength and power, muscular endurance, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and pain perception (PP) in resistance-trained men. Seventeen volunteers (mean ± SD: age = 26 ± 6 years, stature = 182 ± 9 cm, body mass = 84 ± 9 kg, resistance training experience = 7 ± 3 years) consumed placebo or 6 mg kg-1 of anhydrous caffeine 1 h before testing. Muscular power was assessed with seated medicine ball throw and vertical jump exercises, muscular strength with one-repetition maximum (1RM) barbell back squat and bench press exercises, and muscular endurance with repetitions of back squat and bench press exercises (load corresponding to 60% of 1RM) to momentary muscular failure. RPE and PP were assessed immediately after the completion of the back squat and bench press exercises. Compared to placebo, caffeine intake enhanced 1RM back squat performance (+2.8%; effect size [ES] = 0.19; p = .016), which was accompanied by a reduced RPE (+7%; ES = 0.53; p = .037), and seated medicine ball throw performance (+4.3%, ES = 0.32; p = .009). Improvements in 1RM bench press were not noted although there were significant (p = .029) decreases in PP related to this exercise when participants ingested caffeine. The results point to an acute benefit of caffeine intake in enhancing lower-body strength, likely due to a decrease in RPE; upper-, but not lower-body power; and no effects on muscular endurance, in resistance-trained men. Individuals competing in events in which strength and power are important performance-related factors may consider taking 6 mg kg-1 of caffeine pre-training/competition for performance enhancement.

The study examined 68 men divided into groups of beginners and advanced strength trained athletes. The participants performed 5 sets of bench press (BP) at 70% 1RM using either a REG, MED or SLOW metronome guided cadence. Each set was performed to failure and with 3 min of rest between sets. Significant differences in TUT were found between the groups of beginners and advanced athletes for the slow (SLO) 6/0/4/0 tempo in set 1 (p = 0.01) and set 2 (p = 0.04), and for the regular (REG) 2/0/2/0 tempo in set 5 (p = 0.01). Significant differences were documented for total TUT between the beginners and advanced athletes for the SLO 6/0/4/0 tempo (p = 0.04). The results of ANOVA revealed significant differences in the number of repetitions between groups for the SLO 6/0/4/0 tempo in set 4 (p = 0.04) and set 5 (p = 0.04), and for the REG 2/0/2/0 tempo in set 5 (p = 0.01). The main finding of this study is that strength training experience has a significant effect on training volume, both in terms of TUT and REP at a specific constant movement tempo. Significant differences do not occur for each value of the tempo used.

Test-retest reliability of a commercial linear position transducer (GymAware PowerTool) to measure velocity and power in the back squat and bench press. J Strength Cond Res 34(3): 728-737, 2020-This study examined the test-retest reliability of the GymAware PowerTool (GYM) to measure velocity and power in the free-weight back squat and bench press. Twenty-nine academy rugby league players (age: 17.6 ± 1.0 years; body mass: 87.3 ± 20.8 kg) completed 2 test-retest sessions for the back squat followed by 2 test-retest sessions for the bench press. GYM measured mean velocity (MV), peak velocity (PV), mean power (MP), and peak power at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 90% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM). GYM showed good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] and standard error of measurement percentage, respectively) for the measurement of MV at loads of 40 (0.77, 3.9%), 60 (0.83, 4.8%), 80 (0.83, 5.8%), and 90% (0.79, 7.9%) of 1RM in the back squat. In the bench press, good reliability was evident for PV at 40 (0.82, 3.9%), 60 (0.81, 5.1%), and 80% (0.77, 8.4%) of 1RM, and for MV at 80 (0.78, 7.9%) and 90% (0.87, 9.9%) of 1RM. The measurement of MP showed good to excellent levels of reliability across all relative loads (ICC ≥0.75). In conclusion, GYM provides practitioners with reliable kinematic information in the back squat and bench press, at least with loads of 40-90% of 1RM. This suggests that strength and conditioning coaches can use the velocity data to regulate training load according to daily readiness and target specific components of the force-velocity curve. However, caution should be taken when measuring movement velocity at loads <40% of 1RM.

Twelve elite male sailors with extensive strength-training experience participated in a comparison of kinematics and kinetics from the upper body musculature, with upper body push (bench press) and pull (bench pull) movements performed across loads of 10-100% of one repetition maximum (1RM). 1RM strength and force were shown to be greater in the bench press, while velocity and power outputs were greater for the bench pull across the range of loads. While power output was at a similar level for the two movements at a low load (10% 1RM), significantly greater power outputs were observed for the bench pull in comparison to the bench press with increased load. Power output (Pmax) was maximized at higher relative loads for both mean and peak power in the bench pull (78.6 +/- 5.7% and 70.4 +/- 5.4% of 1RM) compared to the bench press (53.3 +/- 1.7% and 49.7 +/- 4.4% of 1RM). Findings can most likely be attributed to differences in muscle architecture, which may have training implications for these muscles.

They were matched into either a Traditional or a Chain training group by 1-repetition maximum (1RM). The Traditional group performed the bench press with conventional equipment, while the Chain group trained with attached chains (5% of weight). Analysis showed a significant increase in 1RM for both groups over 16 sessions, Traditional +11.8% and Chain +17.4%. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant, but suggests the women who trained with attached chains improved their bench press more than the Traditional group.

Limited research has investigated CGBP peak power. Twenty-six strength-trained individuals completed a one-repetition maximum TBP and CGBP. During two other sessions, subjects completed two repetitions as explosively as possible with loads from 20% to 90% for each exercise, with peak power measured by a linear position transducer. A factorial ANOVA calculated between- and within-exercise differences in peak power. Partial correlations controlling for sex determined relationships between absolute and relative strength and peak power load. Peak power for the TBP occurred at 50% 1RM, and 30% 1RM for the CGBP. There were no significant (p = 0.680) differences between peak power at each load when comparing the TBP and CGBP. For the within-exercise analysis, there were generally no significant differences in TBP and CGBP peak power for the 20⁻50% 1RM loads. There were no significant relationships between strength and peak power load (p = 0.100⁻0.587). A peak power loading range of 20⁻50% 1RM for the TBP and CGBP is suggested for strength-trained individuals.

Twenty young men were familiarized with the procedure and the calculation of one-rep max (1RM). In a second session, electromyographic activity values were recorded in both bench press situations (with the feet on the ground vs active hip flexion and knees at 90°) at 60% 1RM. Performing the bench press with the hips and knees flexed produced significantly greater muscle activation of all elevated muscles (p < 0.01; d > 0.5). The pectoralis major showed the greatest activation, followed by the anterior deltoid and the triceps brachii. In addition, the greater activation of the abdominal muscles occurs due to the need to stabilize the core while performing the bench press with hip and knee flexion as well as the lumbar spine due to traction of the hip flexors.

Twenty-seven resistance-trained men (28 ± 4 years; body mass 88.9 ± 12.8 kg; 1 repetition maximum [1RM] bench press 94.8 ± 10.7 kg) completed 2 test-retest sessions, separated by 1 week. In each session, subjects performed single repetitions at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80% of their bench press 1RM. Mean velocity (Vmean), peak velocity (Vpeak), mean force (Fmean), peak force (Fpeak), mean power (Pmean), and peak power (Ppeak) were simultaneously assessed using the 1080Q Synchro and a linear position transducer (GymAware; Kinetic Performance Technology, Canberra, Australia). The overall performance of the 1080Q was both valid (r = 0.94-1.00) and reliable (coefficient of variation [CV] = 1.7-8.0%, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.90-1.00) for all measures, although both fixed and systematic biases were present. When assessed at each of the relative loads, the 1080Q remained valid for all measures apart from Fmean at 30% 1RM (r = 0.78) and Fpeak at 70 (r = 0.81) and 80% (r = 0.57) 1RM. The 1080Q also demonstrated excellent reliability at all relative loads apart from the heaviest, where Vmean (CV = 11.0%, ICC = 0.69), Pmean (CV = 11.4%, ICC = 0.65), and Ppeak (CV = 10.2%, ICC = 0.79) reliability was reduced. These data indicate that athletes and strength and conditioning coaches can confidently use the 1080Q to monitor training progression; however, caution should be taken when assessing performance measures at the either end of the load spectrum.

      The main objective of the current investigation was to evaluate the effects of caffeine on power output and bar velocity during an explosive bench press throw in athletes habituated to caffeine.
Methods:
        
      
      Twelve resistance trained individuals habituated to caffeine ingestion participated in a randomized double-blind experimental design. Each participant performed three identical experimental sessions 60 min after the intake of a placebo, 3, and 6 mg/kg/b.m. of caffeine. In each experimental session, the participants performed 5 sets of 2 repetitions of the bench press throw (with a load equivalent to 30% repetition maximum (RM), measured in a familiarization trial) on a Smith machine, while bar velocity and power output were registered with a rotatory encoder.
Results:
        
      
      In comparison to the placebo, the intake of caffeine increased mean bar velocity during 5 sets of the bench press throw (1.37 ± 0.05 vs. 1.41 ± 0.05 and 1.41 ± 0.06 m/s for placebo, 3, and 6 mg/kg/b.m., respectively; p < 0.01), as well as mean power output (545 ± 117 vs. 562 ± 118 and 560 ± 107 W; p < 0.01). However, caffeine was not effective at increasing peak velocity (p = 0.09) nor peak power output (p = 0.07) during the explosive exercise.
Conclusion:
        
      
      The acute doses of caffeine before resistance exercise may increase mean power output and mean bar velocity during the bench press throw training session in a group of habitual caffeine users. Thus, caffeine prior to ballistic exercises enhances performance during a power-specific resistance training session.

      To date, there have been no studies on the response of wrist tremor to increased muscle activity during exercise. This study aimed to evaluate the wrist tremor response with increasing muscle activity during bench press exercise.
Methods:
        
      
      Triceps muscle activity and wrist tremor response were measured by electromyography and an accelerometer, respectively, during bench press exercise in 11 healthy men without weight-training experience. Subjects performed bench press at 30% repetition maximum (RM), and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and lactate concentration were measured before and after exercise. One week later, an equivalent number of bench presses at 30% RM was performed without weight load as a control trial (CT).
Results:
        
      
      RPEs and lactate concentrations significantly increased after resistance exercise (30% RM) from 7.4 to 14.3 and 1.7 to 4.9, respectively (P<.01), but no such difference was observed in the CT. Muscle activity linearly increased during the 30% RM exercise, and wrist tremors were shown to linearly decrease. A strong negative correlation was observed between the two variables (r=-0.88, P<.001).
Conclusion:
        
      
      We found that wrist tremors during resistance exercise, as measured using an accelerometer, can be used to predict muscle activity.

95,Work volume and strength training responses to resistive exercise improve with periodic heat extraction from the palm.,"Grahn DA, Cao VH, Nguyen CM, Liu MT, Heller HC.","Body core cooling via the palm of a hand increases work volume during resistive exercise. We asked: (a) ""Is there a correlation between elevated core temperatures and fatigue onset during resistive exercise?"" and (b) ""Does palm cooling between sets of resistive exercise affect strength and work volume training responses?"" Core temperature was manipulated by 30-45 minutes of fixed load and duration treadmill exercise in the heat with or without palm cooling. Work volume was then assessed by 4 sets of fixed load bench press exercises. Core temperatures were reduced and work volumes increased after palm cooling (Control: Tes = 39.0 ± 0.1° C, 36 ± 7 reps vs. Cooling: Tes = 38.4 ± 0.2° C, 42 ± 7 reps, mean ± SD, n = 8, p < 0.001). In separate experiments, the impact of palm cooling on work volume and strength training responses were assessed. The participants completed biweekly bench press or pull-up exercises for multiple successive weeks. Palm cooling was applied for 3 minutes between sets of exercise. Over 3 weeks of bench press training, palm cooling increased work volume by 40% (vs. 13% with no treatment; n = 8, p < 0.05). Over 6 weeks of pull-up training, palm cooling increased work volume by 144% in pull-up experienced subjects (vs. 5% over 2 weeks with no treatment; n = 7, p < 0.001) and by 80% in pull-up naïve subjects (vs. 20% with no treatment; n = 11, p < 0.01). Strength (1 repetition maximum) increased 22% over 10 weeks of pyramid bench press training (4 weeks with no treatment followed by 6 weeks with palm cooling; n = 10, p < 0.001). These results verify previous observations about the effects of palm cooling on work volume, demonstrate a link between core temperature and fatigue onset during resistive exercise, and suggest a novel means for improving strength and work volume training responses.

J Strength Cond Res 31(2): 292-297, 2017-The purpose of this study was to compare average concentric velocity (ACV) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) based on repetitions in reserve on the squat, bench press, and deadlift. Fifteen powerlifters (3 women and 12 men, mean age 28.4 ± 8.5 years) worked up to a one repetition maximum (1RM) on each lift. Rating of perceived exertion was recorded on all sets, and the ACV was recorded for all sets performed at 80% of estimated 1RM and higher, up to 1RM. Rating of perceived exertion at 1RM on squat, bench press, and deadlift was 9.6 ± 0.5, 9.7 ± 0.4, and 9.6 ± 0.5, respectively and was not significantly different (p > 0.05). The ACV at 1RM on squat, bench press and deadlift was 0.23 ± 0.05, 0.10 ± 0.04, and 0.14 ± 0.05 m·second, respectively. Squat was faster than both bench press and deadlift (p > 0.001), and deadlift was faster than bench press (p = 0.05). Very strong relationships (r = 0.88-0.91) between percentage 1RM and RPE were observed on each lift. The ACV showed strong (r = -0.79 to -0.87) and very strong (r = -0.90 to 92) inverse relationships with RPE and percentage 1RM on each lift, respectively. We conclude that RPE may be a useful tool for prescribing intensity for squat, bench press, and deadlift in powerlifters, in addition to traditional methods such as percentage of 1RM. Despite high correlations between percentage 1RM and ACV, a ""velocity load profile"" should be developed to prescribe intensity on an individual basis with appropriate accuracy.

97,Mind-muscle connection: effects of verbal instructions on muscle activity during bench press exercise.,"Paoli A, Mancin L, Saoncella M, Grigoletto D, Pacelli FQ, Zamparo P, Schoenfeld BJ, Marcolin G.","Different attentional foci may modify muscle activation during exercises. Our aim was to determine if it is possible to selectively activate the pectoralis major or triceps brachii muscles according to specific verbal instructions provided during the bench press exercise. 13 resistance-trained males (25.6±5.4 yrs, 182.7±9.1 cm, 86.4±9.7 kg) underwent an electromyographic signals acquisition of the sternocostal head, clavicular head of the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoid, and the long head of the triceps brachii (LT) during bench press exercise. Participants performed one non-instructed set (NIS) of 4 repetitions at 50% 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) and one NIS of 4 repetitions at 80% 1-RM. Four additional sets of 4 repetitions at 50% and 80% 1-RM were randomly performed with verbal instructions to isolate the chest muscles (chest instructed set, CIS) or to isolate the triceps muscles (triceps instructed set, TIS). Participants showed significantly higher LT activation during TIS compared to non-instructed set both at 50% (p=0.0199) and 80% 1-RM (p=0.0061) respectively. TIS elicited a significant (p=0.0250) higher activation of LT compared to CIS. Our results suggest that verbal instructions seem to be effective for increasing activity of the triceps brachii but not the pectoralis major during the bench press.

98,Validity and Reliability of a Wearable Inertial Sensor to Measure Velocity and Power in the Back Squat and Bench Press.,"Orange ST, Metcalfe JW, Liefeith A, Marshall P, Madden LA, Fewster CR, Vince RV.","Orange, ST, Metcalfe, JW, Liefeith, A, Marshall, P, Madden, LA, Fewster, CR, and Vince, RV. Validity and reliability of a wearable inertial sensor to measure velocity and power in the back squat and bench press. J Strength Cond Res 33(9): 2398-2408, 2019-This study examined the validity and reliability of a wearable inertial sensor to measure velocity and power in the free-weight back squat and bench press. Twenty-nine youth rugby league players (18 ± 1 years) completed 2 test-retest sessions for the back squat followed by 2 test-retest sessions for the bench press. Repetitions were performed at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 90% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) with mean velocity, peak velocity, mean power (MP), and peak power (PP) simultaneously measured using an inertial sensor (PUSH) and a linear position transducer (GymAware PowerTool). The PUSH demonstrated good validity (Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient [r]) and reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) only for measurements of MP (r = 0.91; ICC = 0.83) and PP (r = 0.90; ICC = 0.80) at 20% of 1RM in the back squat. However, it may be more appropriate for athletes to jump off the ground with this load to optimize power output. Further research should therefore evaluate the usability of inertial sensors in the jump squat exercise. In the bench press, good validity and reliability were evident only for the measurement of MP at 40% of 1RM (r = 0.89; ICC = 0.83). The PUSH was unable to provide a valid and reliable estimate of any other criterion variable in either exercise. Practitioners must be cognizant of the measurement error when using inertial sensor technology to quantify velocity and power during resistance training, particularly with loads other than 20% of 1RM in the back squat and 40% of 1RM in the bench press.

99,Comparison of concentric and eccentric bench press repetitions to failure.,"Kelly SB, Brown LE, Hooker SP, Swan PD, Buman MP, Alvar BA, Black LE.","Eccentric muscle actions (ECC) are characterized by muscle lengthening, despite actin-myosin crossbridge formation. Muscles acting eccentrically are capable of producing higher levels of force compared with muscles acting concentrically. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ECC bench press yields greater strength than concentric (CON) as determined by 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Additionally, a comparison was made examining differences in the number of repetitions to failure at different relative intensities of 1RM. Thirty healthy men (age = 24.63 ± 5.6 years) were tested for 1RM in CON and ECC bench press and the number of repetitions completed at 60, 70, 80, and 90% 1RM. For CON repetitions, the weight was mechanically lowered to the chest, and the participant pressed it up until the elbows were fully extended. The ECC bench press consisted of lowering a barbell from a fully extended elbow position to the chest in a continuous controlled manner for 3 seconds as determined by electronic metronome. Paired t-tests showed that ECC 1RM (115.99 ± 31.08 kg) was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater than CON 1RM (93.56 ± 26.56 kg), and the number of repetitions completed at 90% 1RM was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater in ECC (7.67 ± 3.24) as compared with CON (4.57 ± 2.21). There were no significant differences in number of completed repetitions during CON and ECC bench press at 60, 70, and 80% 1RM. These data indicate that ECC actions yield increased force capabilities (∼120%) as compared with CON in the bench press and may be less prone to fatigue, especially at higher intensities. These differences suggest a need to develop unique strategies for training eccentrically.

# Scholarly Literature Search Version 2 implemented with Flask
Refactored to run a bit faster, but it seems to still be dreadfully slow at times. Currently working on incorporating multiprocessing to speed up the web scraping
## How to use:
Ensure all requirements are met and use a cli to enter "flask run" in the directory (ctrl+c to end session when done)

App can then be accessed locally via http://127.0.0.1:5000/
